CVE-2011-3083
browser/profiles/profile_impl_io_data.cc in Google Chrome before
19.0.1084.46 does not properly handle a malformed ftp URL in the SRC
attribute of a VIDEO element, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via
a crafted web page.
CVE-2011-3084
Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46 does not use a dedicated process for
the loading of links found on an internal page, which might allow
attackers to bypass intended sandbox restrictions via a crafted page.
CVE-2011-3085
The Autofill feature in Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46 does not
properly restrict field values, which allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (UI corruption) and possibly conduct spoofing
attacks via vectors involving long values.
CVE-2011-3086
Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact via vectors involving a STYLE element.
CVE-2011-3087
Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46 does not properly perform window
navigation, which has unspecified impact and remote attack vectors.
CVE-2011-3088
Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46 does not properly draw hairlines,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2011-3089
Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact via vectors involving tables.
CVE-2011-3090
Race condition in Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
other impact via vectors related to worker processes.
CVE-2011-3091
Use-after-free vulnerability in the IndexedDB implementation in Google
Chrome before 19.0.1084.46 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
vectors.
CVE-2011-3092
The regex implementation in Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before
19.0.1084.46, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(invalid write operation) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via unknown vectors.
CVE-2011-3093
Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46 does not properly handle glyphs,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2011-3094
Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46 does not properly handle Tibetan
text, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2011-3095
The OGG container in Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
other impact via unknown vectors that trigger an out-of-bounds write.
CVE-2011-3096
Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46 on
Linux allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
have unspecified other impact by leveraging an error in the GTK
implementation of the omnibox.
CVE-2011-3097
The PDF functionality in Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact by leveraging an out-of-bounds write error in
the implementation of sampled functions.
CVE-2011-3099
Use-after-free vulnerability in the PDF functionality in Google Chrome
before 19.0.1084.46 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors
involving a malformed name for the font encoding.
CVE-2011-3100
Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46 does not properly draw dash paths,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.");
