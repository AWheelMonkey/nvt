  script_tag(name:"impact", value:"a. Windows-based VMware Tools Unsafe Library Loading vulnerability

  In order for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need to lure the user that is logged on a Windows Guest
  Operating System to click on the attacker's file on a network share. This file could be in any file format. The attacker will need
  to have the ability to host their malicious files on a network share.

  b. Windows-based VMware Tools Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability

  In order for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need to be able to plant their malicious executable in a
  certain location on the Virtual Machine of the user. On most recent versions of Windows (XP, Vista) the attacker would need to have
  administrator privileges to plant the malicious executable in the right location.

  c. Windows-based VMware Workstation and Player host privilege escalation

  In order for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need to be able to plant their malicious executable in a
  certain location on the host machine.  On most recent versions of Windows (XP, Vista) the attacker would need to have administrator
  privileges to plant the malicious executable in the right location.

  e. VMware VMnc Codec heap overflow vulnerabilities

  Vulnerabilities in the decoder allow for execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running an application
  utilizing the vulnerable codec.

  For an attack to be successful the user must be tricked into visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious video file on
  a system that has the vulnerable version of the VMnc codec installed.

  f. VMware Remote Console format string vulnerability

  For an attack to be successful, an attacker would need to trick the VMrc user into opening a malicious Web page or following a malicious
  URL. Code execution would be at the privilege level of the user.

  h. Potential information leak via hosted networking stack

  A guest operating system could send memory from the host vmware-vmx process to the virtual network adapter and potentially to the
  host's physical Ethernet wire.

  i. Linux-based vmrun format string vulnerability

  If a vmrun command is issued and processes are listed, code could be executed in the context of the user listing the processes.");

  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"VMware hosted products, vCenter Server and ESX patches resolve multiple security issues:

  a. Windows-based VMware Tools Unsafe Library Loading vulnerability

  A vulnerability in the way VMware libraries are referenced allows for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user.
  This vulnerability is present only on Windows Guest Operating Systems.

  b. Windows-based VMware Tools Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability

  A vulnerability in the way VMware executables are loaded allows for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user.
  This vulnerability is present only on Windows Guest Operating Systems.

  c. Windows-based VMware Workstation and Player host privilege escalation

  A vulnerability in the USB service allows for a privilege escalation. A local attacker on the host of a Windows-based Operating
  System where VMware Workstation or VMware Player is installed could plant a malicious executable on the host and elevate their
  privileges.

  d. Third party library update for libpng to version 1.2.37

  The libpng libraries through 1.2.35 contain an uninitialized-memory-read bug that may have security implications. Specifically,
  1-bit (2-color) interlaced images whose widths are not divisible by 8 may result in several uninitialized bits at the end of
  certain rows in certain interlace passes being returned to the user. An application that failed to mask these out-of-bounds
  pixels might display or process them, albeit presumably with benign results in most cases.

  e. VMware VMnc Codec heap overflow vulnerabilities

  The VMware movie decoder contains the VMnc media codec that is required to play back movies recorded with VMware Workstation,
  VMware Player and VMware ACE, in any compatible media player. The movie decoder is installed as part of VMware Workstation, VMware
  Player and VMware ACE, or can be downloaded as a stand alone package.

  f. VMware Remote Console format string vulnerability

  VMware Remote Console (VMrc) contains a format string vulnerability. Exploitation of this issue may lead to arbitrary code execution on
  the system where VMrc is installed.

  VMrc is present on a system if the VMrc browser plug-in has been installed. This plug-in is required when using the console feature in
  WebAccess. Installation of the plug-in follows after visiting the console tab in WebAccess and choosing 'Install plug-in'. The plug-
  in can only be installed on Internet Explorer and Firefox.

  Under the following two conditions your version of VMrc is likely to be affected:

  - the VMrc plug-in was obtained from vCenter 4.0 or from ESX 4.0 without patch ESX400-200911223-UG and

  - VMrc is installed on a Windows-based system

  g. Windows-based VMware authd remote denial of service

  A vulnerability in vmware-authd could cause a denial of service condition on Windows-based hosts. The denial of service is limited
  to a crash of authd.

  h. Potential information leak via hosted networking stack

  A vulnerability in the virtual networking stack of VMware hosted products could allow host information disclosure.

  i. Linux-based vmrun format string vulnerability

  A format string vulnerability in vmrun could allow arbitrary code execution.");
