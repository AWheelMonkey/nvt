  It was discovered that the Gecko Browser engine did not properly handle
  node removal in the DOM. If the user were tricked into opening a specially
  crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service
  via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of
  the user invoking Xulrunner. (CVE-2011-3659)

  It was discovered that memory corruption could occur during the decoding of
  Ogg Vorbis files. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted
  file, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via
  application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the
  user invoking Xulrunner. (CVE-2012-0444)

  Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin discovered that when processing a malformed
  embedded XSLT stylesheet, Xulrunner can crash due to memory corruption. If
  the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker
  could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
  potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Xulrunner.
  (CVE-2012-0449)

  Gregory Fleischer discovered that requests using IPv6 hostname syntax
  through certain proxies might generate errors. An attacker might be able to
  use this to read sensitive data from the error messages. (CVE-2011-3670)");
