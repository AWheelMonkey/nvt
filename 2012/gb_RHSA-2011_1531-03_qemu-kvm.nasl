  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. qemu-kvm is the user-space component
  for running virtual machines using KVM.

  It was found that qemu-kvm did not properly drop supplemental group
  privileges when the root user started guests from the command line
  (&quot;/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm&quot;) with the &quot;-runas&quot; option. A qemu-kvm process
  started this way could use this flaw to gain access to files on the host
  that are accessible to the supplementary groups and not accessible to the
  primary group. (CVE-2011-2527)

  Note: This issue only affected qemu-kvm when it was started directly from
  the command line. It did not affect the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  platform or applications that start qemu-kvm via libvirt, such as the
  Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager).

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements.
  Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements will be available
  shortly from the Technical Notes document, linked to in the References
  section.

  All users of qemu-kvm are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements. After installing this update, shut down all running virtual
  machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for
  this update to take effect.");
