  An array index error was found in the DeVice Independent (DVI) renderer's
  PK and VF font file parsers. A DVI file that references a specially-crafted
  font file could, when opened, cause Evince to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Evince.
  (CVE-2010-2640, CVE-2010-2641)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the DVI renderer's AFM font
  file parser. A DVI file that references a specially-crafted font file
  could, when opened, cause Evince to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Evince.
  (CVE-2010-2642)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the DVI renderer's TFM font file
  parser. A DVI file that references a specially-crafted font file could,
  when opened, cause Evince to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running Evince. (CVE-2010-2643)

  Note: The above issues are not exploitable unless an attacker can trick the
  user into installing a malicious font file.

  Red Hat would like to thank the Evince development team for reporting these
  issues.  Upstream acknowledges Jon Larimer of IBM X-Force as the original
  reporter of these issues.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct these issues.");
