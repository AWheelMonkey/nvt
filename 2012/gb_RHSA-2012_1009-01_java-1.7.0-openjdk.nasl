  OpenJDK 7 Software Development Kit.

  Multiple flaws were discovered in the CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
  Architecture) implementation in Java. A malicious Java application or
  applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions or modify
  immutable object data. (CVE-2012-1711, CVE-2012-1719)

  It was discovered that the SynthLookAndFeel class from Swing did not
  properly prevent access to certain UI elements from outside the current
  application context. A malicious Java application or applet could use this
  flaw to crash the Java Virtual Machine, or bypass Java sandbox
  restrictions. (CVE-2012-1716)

  Multiple flaws were discovered in the font manager's layout lookup
  implementation. A specially-crafted font file could cause the Java Virtual
  Machine to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges
  of the user running the virtual machine. (CVE-2012-1713)

  Multiple flaws were found in the way the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine
  verified the bytecode of the class file to be executed. A specially-crafted
  Java application or applet could use these flaws to crash the Java Virtual
  Machine, or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-1723,
  CVE-2012-1725)

  It was discovered that java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup did not
  properly honor access modes. An untrusted Java application or applet could
  use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-1726)

  It was discovered that the Java XML parser did not properly handle certain
  XML documents. An attacker able to make a Java application parse a
  specially-crafted XML file could use this flaw to make the XML parser enter
  an infinite loop. (CVE-2012-1724)

  It was discovered that the Java security classes did not properly handle
  Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL). CRL containing entries with duplicate
  certificate serial numbers could have been ignored. (CVE-2012-1718)

  It was discovered that various classes of the Java Runtime library could
  create temporary files with insecure permissions. A local attacker could
  use this flaw to gain access to the content of such temporary files.
  (CVE-2012-1717)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Attempting to compile a SystemTap script using the jstack tapset could
  have failed with an error similar to the following:

  error: the frame size of 272 bytes is larger than 256 bytes
