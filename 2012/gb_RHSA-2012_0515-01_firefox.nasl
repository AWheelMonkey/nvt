  A flaw was found in Sanitiser for OpenType (OTS), used by Firefox to help
  prevent potential exploits in malformed OpenType fonts. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, under certain
  conditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running Firefox. (CVE-2011-3062)

  A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2012-0467, CVE-2012-0468, CVE-2012-0469)

  A web page containing a malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image file
  could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0470)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox used its embedded Cairo library to
  render certain fonts. A web page containing malicious content could cause
  Firefox to crash or, under certain conditions, possibly execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0472)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox rendered certain images using WebGL. A
  web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  under certain conditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0478)

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
  certain multibyte character sets. A web page containing malicious content
  could cause Firefox to run JavaScript code with the permissions of a
  different website. (CVE-2012-0471)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox rendered certain graphics using WebGL.
  A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash.
  (CVE-2012-0473)

  A flaw in Firefox allowed the address bar to display a different website
  than the one the user was visiting. An attacker could use this flaw to
  conceal a malicious URL, possibly tricking a user into believing they are
  viewing a trusted site, or allowing scripts to be loaded from the
  attacker's site, possibly leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
  (CVE-2012-0474)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox decoded the ISO-2022-KR and ISO-2022-CN
  character sets. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox
  to run JavaScript code with the permissions of a different website.
  (CVE-2012-0477)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled RSS and Atom feeds. Invalid
