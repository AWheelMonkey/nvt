CVE-2012-1823
sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in PHP before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2, when
configured as a CGI script (aka php-cgi), does not properly handle
query strings that lack an = (equals sign) character, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by placing command-line
options in the query string, related to lack of skipping a certain
php_getopt for the 'd' case.
CVE-2012-2311
sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in PHP before 5.3.13 and 5.4.x before 5.4.3, when
configured as a CGI script (aka php-cgi), does not properly handle
query strings that contain a %3D sequence but no = (equals sign)
character, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
placing command-line options in the query string, related to lack of
skipping a certain php_getopt for the 'd' case.  NOTE: this
vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-1823.
CVE-2012-2329
Buffer overflow in the apache_request_headers function in
sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in PHP 5.4.x before 5.4.3 allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a long string in
the header of an HTTP request.");
