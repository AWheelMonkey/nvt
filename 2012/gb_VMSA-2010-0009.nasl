  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"ESXi update for ntp and ESX Console OS (COS) updates for COS kernel, openssl, krb5, gcc, bind, gzip, sudo resolve multiple security issues:

  a. Service Console update for COS kernel

  Updated COS package 'kernel' addresses the security issues that are fixed through versions 2.6.18-164.11.1.

  b. ESXi userworld update for ntp

  The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a computer client or server to another server or reference time source.

  A vulnerability in ntpd could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (CPU and bandwidth consumption) by using MODE_PRIVATE
  to send a spoofed (1) request or (2) response packet that triggers a continuous exchange of MODE_PRIVATE error responses between two NTP daemons.

  c. Service Console package openssl updated to 0.9.8e-12.el5_4.1

  OpenSSL is a toolkit implementing SSL v2/v3 and TLS protocols with full-strength cryptography world-wide.

  A memory leak in the zlib could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via vectors that trigger
  incorrect calls to the CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data function.

  d. Service Console update for krb5 to 1.6.1-36.el5_4.1 and pam_krb5 to 2.2.14-15.

  Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by
  using secret-key cryptography.

  Multiple integer underflows in the AES and RC4 functionality in the crypto library could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by providing ciphertext with a length that is too short to be valid.

  e. Service Console package bind updated to 9.3.6-4.P1.el5_4.2

  BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Daemon) is by far the most widely used Domain Name System (DNS) software on the Internet.

  A vulnerability was discovered which could allow remote attacker to add the Authenticated Data (AD) flag to a forged NXDOMAIN response
  for an existing domain.

  f. Service Console package gcc updated to 3.2.3-60

  The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada, as well as libraries for these languages

  GNU Libtool's ltdl.c attempts to open .la library files in the current working directory. This could allow a local user to gain
  privileges via a Trojan horse file. The GNU C Compiler collection (gcc) provided in ESX contains a statically linked version of the
  vulnerable code, and is being replaced.

  g. Service Console package gzip update to 1.3.3-15.rhel3

  gzip is a software application used for file compression

  An integer underflow in gzip's unlzw function on 64-bit platforms may allow a remote attacker to trigger an array index error
  leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted LZW compressed file.

  h. Service Console package sudo updated to 1.6.9p17-6.el5_4

  Sudo (su 'do') allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some
  (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.

  When a pseudo-command is enabled, sudo permits a match between the name of the pseudo-command and the name of an executable file in an
  arbitrary directory, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted executable file.");
