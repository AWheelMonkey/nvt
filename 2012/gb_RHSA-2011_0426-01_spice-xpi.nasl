  The spice-xpi package provides a plug-in that allows the SPICE client to
  run from within Mozilla Firefox.

  An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in the SPICE Firefox plug-in.
  If a user were tricked into visiting a malicious web page with Firefox
  while the SPICE plug-in was enabled, it could cause Firefox to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2011-1179)

  It was found that the SPICE Firefox plug-in used a predictable name for one
  of its log files. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct a
  symbolic link attack, allowing them to overwrite arbitrary files accessible
  to the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0012)

  Users of spice-xpi should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the update,
  Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.");
