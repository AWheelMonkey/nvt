  libraries with emphasis on libraries which work well with the C++ Standard
  Library.

  Invalid pointer dereference flaws were found in the way the Boost regular
  expression library processed certain, invalid expressions. An attacker able
  to make an application using the Boost library process a specially-crafted
  regular expression could cause that application to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
  application. (CVE-2008-0171)

  NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the way the Boost regular
  expression library processed certain, invalid expressions. An attacker able
  to make an application using the Boost library process a specially-crafted
  regular expression could cause that application to crash. (CVE-2008-0172)

  Red Hat would like to thank Will Drewry for reporting these issues.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, the construction of a regular expression object
  could fail when several regular expression objects were created
  simultaneously, such as in a multi-threaded program. With this update, the
  object variables have been moved from the shared memory to the stack. Now,
  the constructing function is thread safe. (BZ#472384)

  * Prior to this update, header files in several Boost libraries contained
  preprocessor directives that the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 4.4 could
  not handle. This update instead uses equivalent constructs that are
  standard C. (BZ#567722)

  All users of boost are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  fix these issues.";
