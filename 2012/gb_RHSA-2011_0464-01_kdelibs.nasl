  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way KHTML, the HTML
  layout engine used by KDE applications such as the Konqueror web browser,
  displayed certain error pages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  perform a cross-site scripting attack against victims by tricking them into
  visiting a specially-crafted URL. (CVE-2011-1168)

  A flaw was found in the way kdelibs checked the user specified hostname
  against the name in the server's SSL certificate. A man-in-the-middle
  attacker could use this flaw to trick an application using kdelibs into
  mistakenly accepting a certificate as if it was valid for the host, if that
  certificate was issued for an IP address to which the user specified
  hostname was resolved to. (CVE-2011-1094)

  Note: As part of the fix for CVE-2011-1094, this update also introduces
  stricter handling for wildcards used in servers' SSL certificates.

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The desktop must be restarted (log out,
  then log back in) for this update to take effect.");
