  under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the
  current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2008-5983)

  It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input
  validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a
  crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via
  application crash. (CVE-2010-1634, CVE-2010-2089)

  Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.
  A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via
  daemon outage. (CVE-2010-3493)

  It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did properly perform
  input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could
  potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. (CVE-2011-1015)

  Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process
  Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote
  attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a
  denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1521)

  It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in
  the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this
  to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7
  users. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-4940)

  It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when
  creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain
  sensitive information. (CVE-2011-4944)

  It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its
  input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit
  this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.
  (CVE-2012-0845)

  It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.
  An attacker could cause a denial of service under certain circumstances.
  This updates adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the
  PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime
  objects with an unpredictable value. (CVE-2012-1150)");
