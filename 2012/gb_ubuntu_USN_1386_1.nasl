  task to kill in out of memory conditions. A local, unprivileged could
  exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2498)

  A flaw was discovered in the TOMOYO LSM's handling of mount system calls.
  An unprivileged user could oops the system causing a denial of service.
  (CVE-2011-2518)

  Han-Wen Nienhuys reported a flaw in the FUSE kernel module. A local user
  who can mount a FUSE file system could cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2011-3353)

  A bug was discovered in the Linux kernel's calculation of OOM (Out of
  memory) scores, that would result in the wrong process being killed. A user
  could use this to kill the process with the highest OOM score, even if that
  process belongs to another user or the system. (CVE-2011-4097)

  A flaw was found in KVM's Programmable Interval Timer (PIT). When a virtual
  interrupt control is not available a local user could use this to cause a
  denial of service by starting a timer. (CVE-2011-4622)

  A flaw was discovered in the XFS filesystem. If a local user mounts a
  specially crafted XFS image it could potential execute arbitrary code on
  the system. (CVE-2012-0038)

  Chen Haogang discovered an integer overflow that could result in memory
  corruption. A local unprivileged user could use this to crash the system.
  (CVE-2012-0044)

  A flaw was found in the linux kernels IPv4 IGMP query processing. A remote
  attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-0207)");
