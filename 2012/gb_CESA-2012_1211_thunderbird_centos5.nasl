tag_insight = "Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
  content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-1970,
  CVE-2012-1972, CVE-2012-1973, CVE-2012-1974, CVE-2012-1975, CVE-2012-1976,
  CVE-2012-3956, CVE-2012-3957, CVE-2012-3958, CVE-2012-3959, CVE-2012-3960,
  CVE-2012-3961, CVE-2012-3962, CVE-2012-3963, CVE-2012-3964)
  
  Content containing a malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image file
  could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3969,
  CVE-2012-3970)
  
  Two flaws were found in the way Thunderbird rendered certain images using
  WebGL. Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, under certain
  conditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3967, CVE-2012-3968)
  
  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird decoded embedded bitmap images in
  Icon Format (ICO) files. Content containing a malicious ICO file could
  cause Thunderbird to crash or, under certain conditions, possibly execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
  (CVE-2012-3966)
  
  A flaw was found in the way the &quot;eval&quot; command was handled by the
  Thunderbird Error Console. Running &quot;eval&quot; in the Error Console while
  viewing malicious content could possibly cause Thunderbird to execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
  (CVE-2012-3980)
  
  An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the way Thunderbird used the
  format-number feature of XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language
  Transformations). Malicious content could possibly cause an information
  leak, or cause Thunderbird to crash. (CVE-2012-3972)
  
  A flaw was found in the location object implementation in Thunderbird.
  Malicious content could use this flaw to possibly allow restricted content
  to be loaded. (CVE-2012-3978)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
