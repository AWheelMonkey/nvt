tag_insight = "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows
  individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration
  information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast
  address. DHCPv6 is the DHCP protocol version for IPv6 networks.

  A flaw was found in the way the dhcpd daemon processed certain DHCPv6
  messages for addresses that had previously been declined and marked as
  abandoned internally. If a remote attacker sent such messages to dhcpd, it
  could cause dhcpd to crash due to an assertion failure if it was running as
  a DHCPv6 server. (CVE-2011-0413)

  Red Hat would like to thank Internet Systems Consortium for reporting this
  issue.

  Users running dhcpd as a DHCPv6 server should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After
  installing this update, all DHCP servers will be restarted automatically.";
