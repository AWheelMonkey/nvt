  framework for caching and optimization of intermediate PHP code.

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the &quot;apc.php&quot; script, which
  provides a detailed analysis of the internal workings of APC and is shipped
  as part of the APC extension documentation. A remote attacker could
  possibly use this flaw to conduct a cross-site scripting attack.
  (CVE-2010-3294)

  Note: The administrative script is not deployed upon package installation.
  It must manually be copied to the web root (the default is
  &quot;/var/www/html/&quot;, for example).

  In addition, the php-pecl-apc packages have been upgraded to upstream
  version 3.1.9, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over
  the previous version. (BZ#662655)

  All users of php-pecl-apc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which fix these issues and add these enhancements. If the &quot;apc.php&quot; script
  was previously deployed in the web root, it must manually be re-deployed to
  replace the vulnerable version to resolve this issue.");
