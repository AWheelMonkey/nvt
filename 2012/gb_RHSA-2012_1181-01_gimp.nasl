  Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
  were found in the GIMP's Adobe Photoshop (PSD) image file plug-in. An
  attacker could create a specially-crafted PSD image file that, when opened,
  could cause the PSD plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2009-3909,
  CVE-2012-3402)

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the GIMP's GIF image format plug-in. An attacker could create a
  specially-crafted GIF image file that, when opened, could cause the GIF
  plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3481)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's KiSS CEL file
  format plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted KiSS palette
  file that, when opened, could cause the CEL plug-in to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3403)

  Red Hat would like to thank Secunia Research for reporting CVE-2009-3909,
  and Matthias Weckbecker of the SUSE Security Team for reporting
  CVE-2012-3481.

  Users of the GIMP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The GIMP must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.");
