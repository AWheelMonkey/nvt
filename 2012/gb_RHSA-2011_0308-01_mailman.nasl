  Multiple input sanitization flaws were found in the way Mailman displayed
  usernames of subscribed users on certain pages. If a user who is subscribed
  to a mailing list were able to trick a victim into visiting one of those
  pages, they could perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the
  victim. (CVE-2011-0707)
