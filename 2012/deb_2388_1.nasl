tag_insight = "Several vulnerabilities were discovered in t1lib, a Postscript Type 1
font rasterizer library, some of which might lead to code execution
through the opening of files embedding bad fonts.

CVE-2010-2642
A heap-based buffer overflow in the AFM font metrics parser
potentially leads to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-0433
Another heap-based buffer overflow in the AFM font metrics
parser potentially leads to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-0764
An invalid pointer dereference allows execution of arbitrary
code using crafted Type 1 fonts.

CVE-2011-1552
Another invalid pointer dereference results in an application
crash, triggered by crafted Type 1 fonts.

CVE-2011-1553
A use-after-free vulnerability results in an application
crash, triggered by crafted Type 1 fonts.

CVE-2011-1554
An off-by-one error results in an invalid memory read and
application crash, triggered by crafted Type 1 fonts.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-3+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-3+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-3.3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-3.3.
