tag_insight = "The main goal of the keepalived project is to add a strong &amp; robust keepalive
  facility to the Linux Virtual Server project. This project is written in C with
  multilayer TCP/IP stack checks. Keepalived implements a framework based on
  three family checks : Layer3, Layer4 &amp; Layer5/7. This framework gives the
  daemon the ability to check the state of an LVS server pool. When one of the
  servers of the LVS server pool is down, keepalived informs the linux kernel via
  a setsockopt call to remove this server entry from the LVS topology. In
  addition keepalived implements an independent VRRPv2 stack to handle director
  failover. So in short keepalived is a userspace daemon for LVS cluster nodes
  healthchecks and LVS directors failover.";
