  A shell command injection flaw was found in the way logrotate handled the
  shred directive. A specially-crafted log file could cause logrotate to
  execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running
  logrotate (root, by default). Note: The shred directive is not enabled by
  default. (CVE-2011-1154)

  A race condition flaw was found in the way logrotate applied permissions
  when creating new log files. In some specific configurations, a local
  attacker could use this flaw to open new log files before logrotate applies
  the final permissions, possibly leading to the disclosure of sensitive
  information. (CVE-2011-1098)

  An input sanitization flaw was found in logrotate. A log file with a
  specially-crafted file name could cause logrotate to abort when attempting
  to process that file a subsequent time. (CVE-2011-1155)

  All logrotate users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches to resolve these issues.");
