tag_insight = "Several issues have been discovered in the MySQL database server. The
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MySQL to a new upstream
version, 5.1.63, which includes additional changes, such as performance
improvements and corrections for data loss defects.  These changes are
described in the MySQL release notes at:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-x.html

CVE-2012-2122, an authentication bypass vulnerability, occurs only when
MySQL has been built in with certain optimisations enabled. The packages
in Debian stable (squeeze) are not known to be affected by this
vulnerability. It is addressed in this update nonetheless, so future
rebuilds will not become vulnerable to this issue.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.1.63-0+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems has been fixed
in version 5.1.62-1 of the mysql-5.1 package and version 5.5.24+dfsg-1
of the mysql-5.5 package.

We recommend that you upgrade your MySQL packages.";
