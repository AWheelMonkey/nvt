  A heap overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU emulated the e1000 network
  interface card. A privileged guest user in a virtual machine whose network
  interface is configured to use the e1000 emulated driver could use this
  flaw to crash QEMU or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host.
  (CVE-2012-0029)

  Red Hat would like to thank Nicolae Mogoreanu for reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Adding support for jumbo frames introduced incorrect network device
  expansion when a bridge is created. The expansion worked correctly with the
  default configuration, but could have caused network setup failures when a
  user-defined network script was used. This update changes the expansion so
  network setup will not fail, even when a user-defined network script is
  used. (BZ#797191)

  * A bug was found in xenconsoled, the Xen hypervisor console daemon. If
  timestamp logging for this daemon was enabled (using both the
  XENCONSOLED_TIMESTAMP_HYPERVISOR_LOG and XENCONSOLED_TIMESTAMP_GUEST_LOG
  options in &quot;/etc/sysconfig/xend&quot;), xenconsoled could crash if the guest
  emitted a lot of information to its serial console in a short period of
  time. Eventually, the guest would freeze after the console buffer was
  filled due to the crashed xenconsoled. Timestamp logging is disabled by
  default. (BZ#797836)

  All xen users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.");
