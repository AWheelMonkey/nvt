tag_insight = "virt-v2v is a tool for converting and importing virtual machines to
  libvirt-managed KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), or Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization.

  Using virt-v2v to convert a guest that has a password-protected VNC console
  to a KVM guest removed that password protection from the converted guest:
  after conversion, a password was not required to access the converted
  guest's VNC console. Now, converted guests will require the same VNC
  console password as the original guest. Note that when converting a guest
  to run on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, virt-v2v will display a
  warning that VNC passwords are not supported. (CVE-2011-1773)

  Note: The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 perl-Sys-Virt update must also be
  installed to correct CVE-2011-1773.

  Bug fixes:

  * When converting a guest virtual machine (VM), whose name contained
  certain characters, virt-v2v would create a converted guest with a
  corrupted name. Now, virt-v2v will not corrupt guest names. (BZ#665883)

  * There were numerous usability issues when running virt-v2v as a non-root
  user. This update makes it simpler to run virt-v2v as a non-root user.
  (BZ#671094)

  * virt-v2v failed to convert a Microsoft Windows guest with Windows
  Recovery Console installed in a separate partition. Now, virt-v2v will
  successfully convert a guest with Windows Recovery Console installed in a
  separate partition by ignoring that partition. (BZ#673066)

  * virt-v2v failed to convert a Red Hat Enterprise Linux guest which did not
  have the symlink &quot;/boot/grub/menu.lst&quot;. With this update, virt-v2v can
  select a grub configuration file from several places. (BZ#694364)

  * This update removes information about the usage of deprecated command
  line options in the virt-v2v man page. (BZ#694370)

  * virt-v2v would fail to correctly change the allocation policy, (sparse or
  preallocated) when converting a guest with QCOW2 image format. The error
  message &quot;Cannot import VM, The selected disk configuration is not
  supported&quot; was displayed. With this update, allocation policy changes to a
  guest with QCOW2 storage will work correctly. (BZ#696089)

  * The options &quot;--network&quot; and &quot;--bridge&quot; can not be used
  in conjunction when converting a guest, but no error message was displayed.
  With this update, virt-v2v will now display an error message if the mutually
  exclusive &quot;--network&quot; and &quot;--bridge&quot; command line opti ...
