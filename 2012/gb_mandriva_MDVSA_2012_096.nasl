  The _ssl module would always disable the CBC IV attack countermeasure
  (CVE-2011-3389).

  A flaw was found in the way the Python SimpleHTTPServer module
  generated directory listings. An attacker able to upload a file
  with a specially-crafted name to a server could possibly perform a
  cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims visiting a listing
  page generated by SimpleHTTPServer, for a directory containing
  the crafted file (if the victims were using certain web browsers)
  (CVE-2011-4940).

  A race condition was found in the way the Python distutils module
  set file permissions during the creation of the .pypirc file. If a
  local user had access to the home directory of another user who is
  running distutils, they could use this flaw to gain access to that
  user&#039;s .pypirc file, which can contain usernames and passwords for
  code repositories (CVE-2011-4944).

  A flaw was found in the way the Python SimpleXMLRPCServer module
  handled clients disconnecting prematurely. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to cause excessive CPU consumption on a server using
  SimpleXMLRPCServer (CVE-2012-0845).

  Hash table collisions CPU usage DoS for the embedded copy of expat
  (CVE-2012-0876).

  A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative
  arrays (dictionaries) in Python. An attacker able to supply a large
  number of inputs to a Python application (such as HTTP POST request
  parameters sent to a web application) that are used as keys when
  inserting data into an array could trigger multiple hash function
  collisions, making array operations take an excessive amount of
  CPU time. To mitigate this issue, randomization has been added to
  the hash function to reduce the chance of an attacker successfully
  causing intentional collisions (CVE-2012-1150).

  The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.");
