  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows
  individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration
  information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast
  address.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the dhcpd daemon handled
  zero-length client identifiers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  send a specially-crafted request to dhcpd, possibly causing it to enter an
  infinite loop and consume an excessive amount of CPU time. (CVE-2012-3571)

  Two memory leak flaws were found in the dhcpd daemon. A remote attacker
  could use these flaws to cause dhcpd to exhaust all available memory by
  sending a large number of DHCP requests. (CVE-2012-3954)

  Upstream acknowledges Markus Hietava of the Codenomicon CROSS project as
  the original reporter of CVE-2012-3571, and Glen Eustace of Massey
  University, New Zealand, as the original reporter of CVE-2012-3954.

  Users of DHCP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this update,
  all DHCP servers will be restarted automatically.");
