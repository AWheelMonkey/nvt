  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0461, CVE-2012-0462, CVE-2012-0464)

  Two flaws were found in the way Firefox parsed certain Scalable Vector
  Graphics (SVG) image files. A web page containing a malicious SVG image
  file could cause an information leak, or cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2012-0456, CVE-2012-0457)

  A flaw could allow a malicious site to bypass intended restrictions,
  possibly leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack if a user were
  tricked into dropping a &quot;javascript:&quot; link onto a frame. (CVE-2012-0455)

  It was found that the home page could be set to a &quot;javascript:&quot; link. If a
  user were tricked into setting such a home page by dragging a link to the
  home button, it could cause Firefox to repeatedly crash, eventually
  leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
  running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0458)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox parsed certain web content containing
  &quot;cssText&quot;. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0459)

  It was found that by using the DOM fullscreen API, untrusted content could
  bypass the mozRequestFullscreen security protections. A web page containing
  malicious web content could exploit this API flaw to cause user interface
  spoofing. (CVE-2012-0460)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled pages with multiple Content
  Security Policy (CSP) headers. This could lead to a cross-site scripting
  attack if used in conjunction with a website that has a header injection
  flaw. (CVE-2012-0451)

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 10.0.3 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * When using the Traditional Chinese locale (zh-TW), a segmentation fault
  sometimes occurred when closing Firefox. (BZ#729632)

  * The java-1.6.0-ibm-plugin and java-1.6.0-sun-pl ...
