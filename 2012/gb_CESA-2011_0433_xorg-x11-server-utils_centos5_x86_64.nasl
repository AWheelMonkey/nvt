tag_insight = "The xorg-x11-server-utils package contains a collection of utilities used
  to modify and query the runtime configuration of the X.Org server. X.Org is
  an open source implementation of the X Window System.

  A flaw was found in the X.Org X server resource database utility, xrdb.
  Certain variables were not properly sanitized during the launch of a user's
  graphical session, which could possibly allow a remote attacker to execute
  arbitrary code with root privileges, if they were able to make the display
  manager execute xrdb with a specially-crafted X client hostname. For
  example, by configuring the hostname on the target system via a crafted
  DHCP reply, or by using the X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP) to
  connect to that system from a host that has a special DNS name.
  (CVE-2011-0465)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank Matthieu Herrb for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team as the
  original reporter.
  
  Users of xorg-x11-server-utils should upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains a backported patch to resolve this issue. All running X.Org
  server instances must be restarted for this update to take effect.";
