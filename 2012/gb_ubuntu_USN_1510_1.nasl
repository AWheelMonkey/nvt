  memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If the user were tricked into
  opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to
  cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code
  with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-1948,
  CVE-2012-1949)

  Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If
  the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could
  possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
  potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
  (CVE-2012-1951, CVE-2012-1952, CVE-2012-1953, CVE-2012-1954)

  Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.
  Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site
  while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker
  could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. (CVE-2012-1955)

  Mario Heiderich discovered that HTML &lt;embed&gt; tags were not filtered out of the
  HTML &lt;description&gt; of RSS feeds. A remote attacker could exploit this to
  conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via javascript execution in the HTML
  feed view. (CVE-2012-1957)

  Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability. If the user were
  tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly
  exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially
  execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
  (CVE-2012-1958)

  Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be
  bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially
  crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the
  privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-1959)

  Tony Payne discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in Mozilla's color
  management library (QCMS). If the user were tricked into opening a specially
  crafted color profile, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a
  denial of service via application crash. (CVE-2012-1960)

  Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header was ignored when its
  value was specified multiple times. An attacker could exploit this to conduct
  clickjacking attack ...
