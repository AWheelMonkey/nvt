tag_insight = "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * IPv6 fragment identification value generation could allow a remote
  attacker to disrupt a target system's networking, preventing legitimate
  users from accessing its services. (CVE-2011-2699, Important)

  * A signedness issue was found in the Linux kernel's CIFS (Common Internet
  File System) implementation. A malicious CIFS server could send a
  specially-crafted response to a directory read request that would result in
  a denial of service or privilege escalation on a system that has a CIFS
  share mounted. (CVE-2011-3191, Important)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled fragmented IPv6 UDP
  datagrams over the bridge with UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
  functionality on. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial
  of service. (CVE-2011-4326, Important)

  * The way IPv4 and IPv6 protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs were
  generated could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject packets and
  possibly hijack connections. Protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs are
  now more random. (CVE-2011-3188, Moderate)

  * A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's FUSE (Filesystem
  in Userspace) implementation. A local user in the fuse group who has access
  to mount a FUSE file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of
  service. (CVE-2011-3353, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the b43 driver in the Linux kernel. If a system had
  an active wireless interface that uses the b43 driver, an attacker able to
  send a specially-crafted frame to that interface could cause a denial of
  service. (CVE-2011-3359, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way CIFS shares with DFS referrals at their root
  were handled. An attacker on the local network who is able to deploy a
  malicious CIFS server could create a CIFS network share that, when mounted,
  would cause the client system to crash. (CVE-2011-3363, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled VLAN 0 frames with
  the priority tag set. When using certain network drivers, an attacker on
  the local network could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2011-3593, Moderate)

  * A flaw in the way memory containing security-related data was handled in
  tpm_read() could allow a local, unprivileged user to read the results of a
  previously run TPM command. (CVE-2011-1162,  ...
