  It was discovered that Java2D did not properly check graphics rendering
  objects before passing them to the native renderer. Malicious input, or an
  untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to crash the Java
  Virtual Machine (JVM), or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-0497)

  It was discovered that the exception thrown on deserialization failure did
  not always contain a proper identification of the cause of the failure. An
  untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java
  sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-0505)

  The AtomicReferenceArray class implementation did not properly check if
  the array was of the expected Object[] type. A malicious Java application
  or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
  (CVE-2011-3571)

  It was discovered that the use of TimeZone.setDefault() was not restricted
  by the SecurityManager, allowing an untrusted Java application or applet to
  set a new default time zone, and hence bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
  (CVE-2012-0503)

  The HttpServer class did not limit the number of headers read from HTTP
  requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make an application
  using HttpServer use an excessive amount of CPU time via a
  specially-crafted request. This update introduces a header count limit
  controlled using the sun.net.httpserver.maxReqHeaders property. The default
  value is 200. (CVE-2011-5035)

  The Java Sound component did not properly check buffer boundaries.
  Malicious input, or an untrusted Java application or applet could use this
  flaw to cause the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to crash or disclose a portion
  of its memory. (CVE-2011-3563)

  A flaw was found in the AWT KeyboardFocusManager that could allow an
  untrusted Java application or applet to acquire keyboard focus and possibly
  steal sensitive information. (CVE-2012-0502)

  It was discovered that the CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
  Architecture) implementation in Java did not properly protect repository
  identifiers on certain CORBA objects. This could have been used to modify
  immutable object data. (CVE-2012-0506)

  An off-by-one flaw, causing a stack overflow, was found in the unpacker for
  ZIP files. A specially-crafted ZIP archive could cause the Java Virtual
  Machine (JVM) to crash when opened. (CVE-2012-0501)

  This erratum also upgrades the OpenJDK package to IcedTea6 1.10.6. Refer to
