  It fixes lots of security issues, some already exploited in

  Details can be found on:
  https://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb12-03.html

  These vulnerabilities could cause a crash and potentially
  allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.
  This update also resolves a universal cross-site scripting
  vulnerability that could be used to take actions on a
  user's behalf on any website or webmail provider, if the
  user visits a malicious website. There are reports that
  this vulnerability (CVE-2012-0767) is being exploited in
  the wild in active targeted attacks designed to trick the
  user into clicking on a malicious link delivered in an
  email message (Internet Explorer on Windows only).");
