tag_insight = "X.Org is an open source implementation of the X Window System. It provides
  the basic low-level functionality that full-fledged graphical user
  interfaces are designed upon.

  A flaw was found in the way the X.Org server handled lock files. A local
  user with access to the system console could use this flaw to determine the
  existence of a file in a directory not accessible to the user, via a
  symbolic link attack. (CVE-2011-4028)
  
  A race condition was found in the way the X.Org server managed temporary
  lock files. A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link
  attack, allowing them to make an arbitrary file world readable, leading to
  the disclosure of sensitive information. (CVE-2011-4029)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank the researcher with the nickname vladz for
  reporting these issues.
  
  This update also fixes the following bugs:
  
  * Prior to this update, the KDE Display Manager (KDM) could pass invalid
  24bpp pixmap formats to the X server. As a consequence, the X server could
  unexpectedly abort. This update modifies the underlying code to pass the
  correct formats. (BZ#651934, BZ#722860)
  
  * Prior to this update, absolute input devices, like the stylus of a
  graphic tablet, could become unresponsive in the right-most or bottom-most
  screen if the X server was configured as a multi-screen setup through
  multiple &quot;Device&quot; sections in the xorg.conf file. This update changes the
  screen crossing behavior so that absolute devices are always mapped across
  all screens. (BZ#732467)
  
  * Prior to this update, the misleading message &quot;Session active, not
  inhibited, screen idle. If you see this test, your display server is broken
  and you should notify your distributor.&quot; could be displayed after resuming
  the system or re-enabling the display, and included a URL to an external
  web page. This update removes this message. (BZ#748704)
  
  * Prior to this update, the erroneous input handling code of the Xephyr
  server disabled screens on a screen crossing event. The focus was only on
  the screen where the mouse was located and only this screen was updated
  when the Xephyr nested X server was configured in a multi-screen setup.
  This update removes this code and Xephyr now correctly updates screens in
  multi-screen setups. (BZ#757792)
  
  * Prior to this update, raw events did not contain relative axis values. As
  a consequence, clients which relied on relative values for functioning did
  not behave as expected. This update sets the values to the original driver
  values instead of the already transf ...
