  for running virtual machines using KVM.

  It was found that the virtio-blk driver in qemu-kvm did not properly
  validate read and write requests from guests. A privileged guest user could
  use this flaw to crash the guest or, possibly, execute arbitrary code on
  the host. (CVE-2011-1750)

  It was found that the PIIX4 Power Management emulation layer in qemu-kvm
  did not properly check for hot plug eligibility during device removals. A
  privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code on the host. (CVE-2011-1751)

  Red Hat would like to thank Nelson Elhage for reporting CVE-2011-1751.

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements.
  Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements will be available
  shortly from the Technical Notes document, linked to in the References
  section.

  All users of qemu-kvm should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues, and fix the bugs and
  add the enhancements noted in the Technical Notes. After installing this
  update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines
  have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.

  4. Solution:

  Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
  relevant to your system have been applied.

  This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
  use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at the linked
  references.");
