  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The dynamic LDAP back end is a plug-in for BIND that provides back-end
  capabilities to LDAP databases. It features support for dynamic updates
  and internal caching that help to reduce the load on LDAP servers.

  A flaw was found in the way bind-dyndb-ldap handled LDAP query errors. If a
  remote attacker were able to send DNS queries to a named server that is
  configured to use bind-dyndb-ldap, they could trigger such an error with a
  DNS query leveraging bind-dyndb-ldap's insufficient escaping of the LDAP
  base DN (distinguished name). This would result in an invalid LDAP query
  that named would retry in a loop, preventing it from responding to other
  DNS queries. With this update, bind-dyndb-ldap only attempts to retry one
  time when an LDAP search returns an unexpected error. (CVE-2012-2134)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ronald van Zantvoort for reporting this issue.

  All bind-dyndb-ldap users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
  effect, the named service must be restarted.");
