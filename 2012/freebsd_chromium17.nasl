CVE-2012-2815
Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43 allows remote attackers to obtain
potentially sensitive information from a fragment identifier by
leveraging access to an IFRAME element associated with a different
domain.
CVE-2012-2817
Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact via vectors related to tables that have
sections.
CVE-2012-2818
Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact via vectors related to the layout of
documents that use the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) counters feature.
CVE-2012-2819
The texSubImage2D implementation in the WebGL subsystem in Google
Chrome before 20.0.1132.43 does not properly handle uploads to
floating-point textures, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (assertion failure and application crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted web page, as
demonstrated by certain WebGL performance tests, aka rdar problem
11520387.
CVE-2012-2820
Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43 does not properly implement SVG
filters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2012-2821
The autofill implementation in Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43 does
not properly display text, which has unspecified impact and remote
attack vectors.
CVE-2012-2822
The PDF functionality in Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via
unspecified vectors.
CVE-2012-2823
Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact via vectors related to SVG resources.
CVE-2012-2824
Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact via vectors related to SVG painting.
CVE-2012-2826
Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43 does not properly implement texture
conversion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2012-2827
Use-after-free vulnerability in the UI in Google Chrome before
20.0.1132.43 on Mac OS X allows attackers to cause a denial of service
or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.
CVE-2012-2828
Multiple integer overflows in the PDF functionality in Google Chrome
before 20.0.1132.43 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
document.
CVE-2012-2829
Use-after-free vulnerability in the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
implementation in Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
other impact via vectors related to the :first-letter pseudo-element.
CVE-2012-2830
Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43 does not properly set array values,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect
pointer use) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
vectors.
CVE-2012-2831
Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact via vectors related to SVG references.
CVE-2012-2832
The image-codec implementation in the PDF functionality in Google
Chrome before 20.0.1132.43 does not initialize an unspecified pointer,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
have unknown other impact via a crafted document.
CVE-2012-2833
Buffer overflow in the JS API in the PDF functionality in Google
Chrome before 20.0.1132.43 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
vectors.
CVE-2012-2834
Integer overflow in Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
other impact via crafted data in the Matroska container format.");
