  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"BusyBox provides a single binary that includes versions of a large number
  of system commands, including a shell. This can be very useful for
  recovering from certain types of system failures, particularly those
  involving broken shared libraries.

  A buffer underflow flaw was found in the way the uncompress utility of
  BusyBox expanded certain archive files compressed using Lempel-Ziv
  compression. If a user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted
  archive file with uncompress, it could cause BusyBox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  BusyBox. (CVE-2006-1168)

  The BusyBox DHCP client, udhcpc, did not sufficiently sanitize certain
  options provided in DHCP server replies, such as the client hostname. A
  malicious DHCP server could send such an option with a specially-crafted
  value to a DHCP client. If this option's value was saved on the client
  system, and then later insecurely evaluated by a process that assumes the
  option is trusted, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of that process. Note: udhcpc is not used on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux by default, and no DHCP client script is provided with the busybox
  packages. (CVE-2011-2716)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, the cp command wrongly returned the exit code 0 to
  indicate success if a device ran out of space while attempting to copy
  files of more than 4 gigabytes. This update modifies BusyBox, so that in
  such situations, the exit code 1 is returned. Now, the cp command shows
  correctly whether a process failed. (BZ#689659)

  * Prior to this update, the findfs command failed to check all existing
  block devices on a system with thousands of block device nodes in &quot;/dev/&quot;.
  This update modifies BusyBox so that findfs checks all block devices even
  in this case. (BZ#756723)

  All users of busybox are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues.");
