tag_insight = "teTeX is an implementation of TeX. TeX takes a text file and a set of
  formatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice
  Independent (DVI) file as output.

  teTeX embeds a copy of t1lib to rasterize bitmaps from PostScript Type 1
  fonts. The following issues affect t1lib code:
  
  Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way t1lib processed
  Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) files. If a specially-crafted font file was opened
  by teTeX, it could cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2010-2642,
  CVE-2011-0433)
  
  An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted
  font file could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running teTeX.
  (CVE-2011-0764)
  
  A use-after-free flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file
  could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2011-1553)
  
  An off-by-one flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file could,
  when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2011-1554)
  
  An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted
  font file could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash. (CVE-2011-1552)
  
  teTeX embeds a copy of Xpdf, an open source Portable Document Format (PDF)
  file viewer, to allow adding images in PDF format to the generated PDF
  documents. The following issues affect Xpdf code:
  
  An uninitialized pointer use flaw was discovered in Xpdf. If pdflatex was
  used to process a TeX document referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it
  could cause pdflatex to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2010-3702)
  
  An array index error was found in the way Xpdf parsed PostScript Type 1
  fonts embedded in PDF documents. If pdflatex was used to process a TeX
  document referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it could cause pdflatex
  to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running pdflatex. (CVE-2010-3704)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank the Evince development team for reporting
  CVE-2010-2642. Upstream acknowledges Jon Larimer of IBM X-Force as the
  original reporter of CVE-2010-2642.
  
  All users of tetex are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.";
