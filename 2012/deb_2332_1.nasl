tag_insight = "Paul McMillan, Mozilla and the Django core team discovered several
vulnerabilities in Django, a Python web framework:

CVE-2011-4136

When using memory-based sessions and caching, Django sessions are
stored directly in the root namespace of the cache. When user data is
stored in the same cache, a remote user may take over a session.

CVE-2011-4137, CVE-2011-4138

Django's field type URLfield by default checks supplied URL's by
issuing a request to it, which doesn't time out. A Denial of Service
is possible by supplying specially prepared URL's that keep the
connection open indefinitely or fill the Django's server memory.

CVE-2011-4139

Django used X-Forwarded-Host headers to construct full URL's. This
header may not contain trusted input and could be used to poison the
cache.

CVE-2011-4140

The CSRF protection mechanism in Django does not properly handle
web-server configurations supporting arbitrary HTTP Host headers,
which allows remote attackers to trigger unauthenticated forged
requests.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1+lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze2.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem
has been fixed in version 1.3.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.";
