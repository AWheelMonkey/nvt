  memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a
  specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a
  denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the
  privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-1948, CVE-2012-1949)

  Mario Gomes discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.
  Drag-and-drop events in the address bar may cause the address of the previous
  site to be displayed while a new page is loaded. An attacker could exploit this
  to conduct phishing attacks. (CVE-2012-1950)

  Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the
  user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could
  possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
  potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
  (CVE-2012-1951, CVE-2012-1952, CVE-2012-1953, CVE-2012-1954)

  Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated.
  Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site
  while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker
  could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. (CVE-2012-1955)

  Mario Heiderich discovered that HTML &lt;embed&gt; tags were not filtered out of the
  HTML &lt;description&gt; of RSS feeds. A remote attacker could exploit this to
  conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via javascript execution in the HTML
  feed view. (CVE-2012-1957)

  Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability. If the user were
  tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly
  exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially
  execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-1958)

  Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be
  bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially
  crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the
  privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-1959)

  Tony Payne discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in Mozilla's color
  management library (QCMS). If the user were tricked into opening a specially
  crafted color profile, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a
