tag_insight = "Multiple vulnerabilities was found and corrected in busybox:

  The decompress function in ncompress allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (crash), and possibly execute arbitrary code,
  via crafted data that leads to a buffer underflow (CVE-2006-1168).

  A missing DHCP option checking / sanitization flaw was reported for
  multiple DHCP clients.  This flaw may allow DHCP server to trick DHCP
  clients to set e.g. system hostname to a specially crafted value
  containing shell special characters.  Various scripts assume that
  hostname is trusted, which may lead to code execution when hostname
  is specially crafted (CVE-2011-2716).

  Additionally for Mandriva Enterprise Server 5 various problems in
  the ka-deploy and uClibc packages was discovered and fixed with
  this advisory.

  The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.

  Update:
  The wrong set of packages was sent out with the MDVSA-2012:129 advisory
  that lacked the fix for CVE-2006-1168. This advisory provides the
  correct packages.";
