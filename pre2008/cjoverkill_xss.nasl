tag_summary = "The remote server runs a version of CjOverkill, a free traffic trading 
script which is as old as or older than version 4.0.3.

The remote version of this software is affected by a cross-site scripting 
vulnerability in the script 'trade.php'. This issue is due to a failure 
of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

As a result of this vulnerability, it is possible for a remote attacker
to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed 
in the browser of an unsuspecting user when followed. 

This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials 
as well as other attacks.";

tag_solution = "Upgrade to version 4.0.4 or newer.";
