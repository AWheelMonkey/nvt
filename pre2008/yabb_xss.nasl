  As a result of this vulnerability, it is possible for a remote
  attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will
  be executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user when followed.

  Another flaw in YaBB may allow an attacker to execute malicious
  administrative commands on the remote host by sending malformed IMG
  tags in posts to the remote YaBB forum and waiting for the forum
  administrator to view one of the posts.");
