 script_tag(name : "solution" , value : "1. Rename following directories to something hard to guess:
 - Data
 - User_carts
 - Orders
 - Auth_data

2. Make these changes to dcshop.setup and dcshop_admin.setup. 

- In dcshop.setup, modify:

$datadir = '$cgidir/Data'
$cart_dir = '$cgidir/User_carts'
$order_dir = '$cgidir/Orders'

- In dcshop_admin.setup, modify:

$password_file_dir = '$path/Auth_data'

3. Rename dcshop.setup and dcshop_admin.setup to something difficult to guess.
For example, dcshop_4314312.setup and dcshop_admin_3124214.setup

4. Edit dcshop.cgi, dcshop_admin.cgi, and dcshop_checkout.cgi and modify the 
require statement for dcshop.setup and dcshop_admin.setup. That is:

- In dcshop.cgi, modify

require '$path/dcshop.setup'

so that it uses new setup file. For example,

require '$path/dcshop_4314312.setup'

- In dcshop_admin.cgi, modify

require '$path/dcshop.setup'
require '$path/dcshop_admin.setup'

so that it uses new setup file. For example,

require '$path/dcshop_4314312.setup'
require '$path/dcshop_admin_3124214.setup'

- In dcshop_checkout.cgi, modify

require '$path/dcshop.setup'

so that it uses new setup file. For example,

require '$path/dcshop_4314312.setup'

5. Save following file as index.html and upload it to your 
/cgi-bin/dcshop directory, thereby hiding directory listing. On 
NT servers, you may have to rename this file to default.htm.

http://www.dcscripts.com/FAQ/

This page show 'Internal Server Error' so it is not an error page...
it's just an index.html file to HIDE directories.

6. Replace your current files with above files
