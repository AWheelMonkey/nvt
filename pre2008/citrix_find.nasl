  tag_summary = "A Citrix server is running on this machine.

  Citrix servers allow a Windows user to remotely
  obtain a graphical login (and therefore act as a local
  user on the remote host). 

  NOTE: by default the Citrix Server application 
  utilizes a weak 40 bit obfuscation algorithm (not
  even a true encryption).  If the default settings have
  not been changed, there already exists tools which can
  be used to passively ferret userIDs and passwords as they
  traverse a network.

  If this server is located within your DMZ, the risk is
  substantially higher, as Citrix necessarily requires
  access into the internal network for applications like
  SMB browsing, file sharing, email synchronization, etc.

  If an attacker gains a valid login and password, he may
  be able to use this service to gain further access on
  the remote host or remote network. This protocol has also
  been shown to be  vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.";

  that the server is configured to utilize strong encryption.";
