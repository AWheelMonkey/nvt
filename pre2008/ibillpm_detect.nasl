tag_summary = "The 'ibillpm.pl' CGI is installed.
Some versions of this CGI use a weak password management system
that can be brute-forced.

** No flaw was tested. Your script might be a safe version.

Solutions : upgrade the script if possible. If not:
1) Move the script elsewhere (security through obscurity)
2) Request that iBill fix it.
3) Configure your web server so that only addreses from ibill.com
   may access it.";
