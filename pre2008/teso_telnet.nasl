This probably means it overflows one of its internal buffers and
crashes. It is likely an attacker could abuse this bug to gain
control over the remote host's superuser.

# This helper function counts AYT responses in the input stream.
# The input is read until 1. the expected number of responses is found,

# At this moment, any occurrence of "Yes" or "yes" is supposed to be such
# a response. Of course, this is wrong: some FreeBSD was observed to react
# with "load: 0.12  cmd: .log 20264 [running] 0.00u 0.00s 0% 620k"
# when the telnet negotiation have been completed. Unfortunately, adding
# another pattern to this code would be too painful (hence the negotiation
# tricks in attack()).
#
# In order to avoid an infinite loop (when testing a host that generates
# lots of junk, intentionally or unintentionally), I stop when I have read
# more than 100 * max bytes.

# here (easily) because they choke on '\0' and many telnet servers send
# this character
