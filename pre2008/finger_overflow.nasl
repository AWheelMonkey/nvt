"The remote finger daemon abruptly closes the connection
when it receives a too long request.
It might be vulnerable to an exploitable buffer overflow; 
so a cracker might run arbitrary code on this machine.

*** Note that OpenVAS did not crash the service, so this
*** might be a false positive.
*** However, if the finger service is run through inetd
*** (a very common configuration), it is impossible to 
*** reliably test this kind of flaw.

Solution: Disable your finger daemon,
	 apply the latest patches from your vendor,
	 or a safer software.");
