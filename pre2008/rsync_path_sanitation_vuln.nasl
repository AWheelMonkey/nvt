  by malicious users to read or write arbitrary files on a vulnerable system.

  rsync is a software product for keeping files synched across multiple
  systems.  Rsync is a network-based program and typically communicates
  over TCP port 873.";

  error, would allow a remote attacker to gain access to the remote system.";

  Successful exploitation requires that the rsync daemon is *not* running chrooted.

  *** Since rsync does not advertise its version number
  *** and since there are little details about this flaw at
  *** this time, this might be a false positive";
