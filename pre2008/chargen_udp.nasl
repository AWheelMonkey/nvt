  Description :

  When contacted, chargen responds with some random characters (something
  like all the characters in the alphabet in a row). When contacted via UDP, it
  will respond with a single UDP packet.

  The purpose of this service was to mostly to test the TCP/IP protocol
  by itself, to make sure that all the packets were arriving at their
  destination unaltered. It is unused these days, so it is suggested
  you disable it, as an attacker may use it to set up an attack against
  this host, or against a third party host using this host as a relay.";

  tag_impact = "An easy attack is 'ping-pong' in which an attacker spoofs a packet between
  two machines running chargen. This will cause them to spew characters at
  each other, slowing the machines down and saturating the network.";
