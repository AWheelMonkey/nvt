tag_summary = "The remote finger service appears to vulnerable to a remote
attack which can disrupt the service of the finger daemon.
This denial of service does not effect other services that
may be running on the remote computer, only the finger
service can be disrupted.

akfingerd version 0.5 or earlier is running on the remote
host.  This daemon has a history of security problems, 
make sure that you are running the latest version of 
akfingerd.

Versions 0.5 and earlier of akfingerd are vulnerable to a
remote denial of service attack.  They are also vulnerable
to several local attacks.";
