tag_summary = "RedHat Linux 6.0 installs by default a squid cache manager cgi script with
no restricted access permissions. This script could be used to perform a
port scan from the cgi-host machine.";

tag_solution = "If you are not using the box as a Squid www proxy/cache server then
uninstall the package by executing:
/etc/rc.d/init.d/squid stop ; rpm -e squid

If you want to continue using the Squid proxy server software, make the
following actions to tighten security access to the manager interface:
mkdir /home/httpd/protected-cgi-bin
mv /home/httpd/cgi-bin/cachemgr.cgi /home/httpd/protected-cgi-bin/

And add the following directives to /etc/httpd/conf/access.conf and
srm.conf:

--- start access.conf segment ---
# Protected cgi-bin directory for programs that
# should not have public access
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from localhost
#allow from .your_domain.com
AllowOverride None
Options ExecCGI
--- end access.conf segment ---

--- start srm.conf segment ---
ScriptAlias /protected-cgi-bin/ /home/httpd/protected-cgi-bin/
--- end srm.conf segment ---";
