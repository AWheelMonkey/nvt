CVE-2015-3143 
NTLM-authenticated connections could be wrongly reused for requests
without any credentials set, leading to HTTP requests being sent
over the connection authenticated as a different user. This is
similar to the issue fixed in DSA-2849-1.

CVE-2015-3144 
When parsing URLs with a zero-length hostname (such as 'http://:80'),
libcurl would try to read from an invalid memory address. This could
allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash). This
issue only affects the upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid)
distributions.

CVE-2015-3145When parsing HTTP cookies, if the parsed cookie's path 
element
consists of a single double-quote, libcurl would try to write to an
invalid heap memory address. This could allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash). This issue only affects the
upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions.

CVE-2015-3148 
When doing HTTP requests using the Negotiate authentication method
along with NTLM, the connection used would not be marked as
authenticated, making it possible to reuse it and send requests for
one user over the connection authenticated as a different user.");
