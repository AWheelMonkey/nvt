CVE-2014-9297
Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team, Sebastian Krahmer of
the SUSE Security Team and Harlan Stenn of Network Time Foundation
discovered that the length value in extension fields is not properly
validated in several code paths in ntp_crypto.c, which could lead to
information leakage or denial of service (ntpd crash).

Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team reported that ACLs
based on IPv6 ::1 addresses can be bypassed.");
