Gary Kwong, Andrew McCreight, Georg Fritzsche, and Carsten Book discovered multiple
memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to
cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4513,
CVE-2015-4514)

Tim Brown discovered that Firefox discloses the hostname during NTLM
authentication in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website with NTLM v1 enabled, an attacker
could exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2015-4515)

Mario Heiderich and Frederik Braun discovered that CSP could be bypassed
in reader mode in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening
a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2015-4518)

Tyson Smith and David Keeler discovered a use-after-poison and buffer
overflow in NSS. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7181, CVE-2015-7182)

Ryan Sleevi discovered an integer overflow in NSPR. If a user were tricked
in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2015-7183)

Jason Hamilton, Peter Arremann and Sylvain Giroux discovered that panels
created via the Addon SDK with { script: false } could still execute
inline script. If a user installed an addon that relied on this as a
security mechanism, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, depending on the source of the panel
content. (CVE-2015-7187)

Micha&#322  Bentkowski discovered that adding white-space to hostnames that are
IP address can bypass same-origin protections. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
