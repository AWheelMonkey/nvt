Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-0813, CVE-2015-0815, CVE-2015-0801)

A flaw was found in the way documents were loaded via resource URLs.
An attacker could use this flaw to bypass certain restrictions and under
certain conditions even execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-0816)

A flaw was found in the Beacon interface implementation in Thunderbird.
A web page containing malicious content could allow a remote attacker to
conduct a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. (CVE-2015-0807)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Steve Fink, Mariusz
Mlynski, Christoph Kerschbaumer, Muneaki Nishimura, Olli Pettay, Boris
Zbarsky, and Aki Helin as the original reporters of these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 31.6.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 31.6.0, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.
