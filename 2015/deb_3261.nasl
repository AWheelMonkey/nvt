    script_tag(name: "summary",   value: "Multiple vulnerabilities were
discovered in libmodule-signature-perl, a Perl module to manipulate CPAN
SIGNATURE files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2015-3406
John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature could parse the
unsigned portion of the SIGNATURE file as the signed portion due to
incorrect handling of PGP signature boundaries.

CVE-2015-3407
John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handles
files that are not listed in the SIGNATURE file. This includes some
files in the t/ directory that would execute when tests are run.

CVE-2015-3408
John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature uses two argument
open() calls to read the files when generating checksums from the
signed manifest. This allows to embed arbitrary shell commands into
the SIGNATURE file that would execute during the signature
verification process.

CVE-2015-3409
John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handles
module loading, allowing to load modules from relative paths in
@INC. A remote attacker providing a malicious module could use this
issue to execute arbitrary code during signature verification.

Note that libtest-signature-perl received an update for compatibility
with the fix for CVE-2015-3407
