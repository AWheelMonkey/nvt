an advanced key management facility and is compliant with the proposed

standard as described by several RFCs.

GnuPG 2.0 is a newer version of GnuPG with additional support for
S/MIME.  It has a different design philosophy that splits
functionality up into several modules. The S/MIME and smartcard functionality
is provided by the gnupg2-smime package.
