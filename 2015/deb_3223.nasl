discovered in ntp, an implementation of the Network Time Protocol:

CVE-2015-1798 
When configured to use a symmetric key with an NTP peer, ntpd would
accept packets without MAC as if they had a valid MAC. This could
allow a remote attacker to bypass the packet authentication and send
malicious packets without having to know the symmetric key.

CVE-2015-1799 
When peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric
association, ntpd would update its internal state variables before
the MAC of the NTP messages was validated. This could allow a remote
attacker to cause a denial of service by impeding synchronization
between NTP peers.

Additionally, it was discovered that generating MD5 keys using ntp-keygen
on big endian machines would either trigger an endless loop, or generate
non-random keys.");
