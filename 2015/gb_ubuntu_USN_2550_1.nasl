issue during anchor navigations in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this
to bypass same-origin policy restrictions. (CVE-2015-0801)

Bobby Holley discovered that windows created to hold privileged UI content
retained access to privileged internal methods if navigated to
unprivileged content. An attacker could potentially exploit this in
combination with another flaw, in order to execute arbitrary script in a
privileged context. (CVE-2015-0802)

Several type confusion issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2015-0803, CVE-2015-0804)

Abhishek Arya discovered memory corruption issues during 2D graphics
rendering. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-0805, CVE-2015-0806)

Christoph Kerschbaumer discovered that CORS requests from
navigator.sendBeacon() followed 30x redirections after preflight. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site request forgery
(XSRF) attacks. (CVE-2015-0807)

Mitchell Harper discovered an issue with memory management of simple-type
arrays in WebRTC. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause
undefined behaviour. (CVE-2015-0808)

Felix Gr&#246 bert discovered an out-of-bounds read in the QCMS colour
management library. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain
sensitive information. (CVE-2015-0811)

Armin Razmdjou discovered that lightweight themes could be installed
in Firefox without a user approval message, from Mozilla subdomains
over HTTP without SSL. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this by
conducting a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack to install themes without
user approval. (CVE-2015-0812)

Aki Helin discovered a use-after-free when playing MP3 audio files using
the Fluendo MP3 GStreamer plugin in certain circumstances. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via applicatio ...
