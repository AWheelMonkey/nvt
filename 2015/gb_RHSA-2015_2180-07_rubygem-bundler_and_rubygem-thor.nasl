  script_tag(name: "insight", value: "Bundler manages an application's
dependencies through its entire life, across many machines, systematically and
repeatably. Thor is a toolkit for building powerful command-line interfaces.

A flaw was found in the way Bundler handled gems available from multiple
sources. An attacker with access to one of the sources could create a
malicious gem with the same name, which they could then use to trick a user
into installing, potentially resulting in execution of code from the
attacker-supplied malicious gem. (CVE-2013-0334)

Bundler has been upgraded to upstream version 1.7.8 and Thor has been
upgraded to upstream version 1.19.1, both of which provide a number of bug
fixes and enhancements over the previous versions. (BZ#1194243, BZ#1209921)

All rubygem-bundler and rubygem-thor users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
