  script_tag(name: "insight", value: "The net-snmp packages provide various
libraries and tools for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), including
an SNMP library, an extensible agent, tools for requesting or setting
information from SNMP agents, tools for generating and handling SNMP traps, a
version of the netstat command which uses SNMP, and a Tk/Perl Management
Information Base (MIB) browser.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way snmptrapd handled certain
SNMP traps when started with the '-OQ' option. If an attacker sent an SNMP
trap containing a variable with a NULL type where an integer variable type
was expected, it would cause snmptrapd to crash. (CVE-2014-3565)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, the clientaddr option in the snmp.conf file affected outgoing
messages sent only over IPv4. With this release, outgoing IPv6 messages are
correctly sent from the interface specified by clientaddr. (BZ#1190679)

* The Net-SNMP daemon, snmpd, did not properly clean memory when reloading
its configuration file with multiple 'exec' entries. Consequently, the
daemon terminated unexpectedly. Now, the memory is properly cleaned, and
snmpd no longer crashes on reload. (BZ#1228893)

* Prior to this update, snmpd did not parse complete IPv4 traffic
statistics, but reported the number of received or sent bytes in the
IP-MIB::ipSystemStatsTable only for IPv6 packets and not for IPv4.
This affected objects ipSystemStatsInOctets, ipSystemStatsOutOctets,
ipSystemStatsInMcastOctets, and ipSystemStatsOutMcastOctets. Now, the
statistics reported by snmpd are collected for IPv4 as well. (BZ#1235697)

* The Net-SNMP daemon, snmpd, did not correctly detect the file system
change from read-only to read-write. Consequently, after remounting the
file system into the read-write mode, the daemon reported it to be still
in the read-only mode. A patch has been applied, and snmpd now detects the
mode changes as expected. (BZ#1241897)

All net-snmp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.
