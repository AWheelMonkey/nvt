CVE-2015-5278 
Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered an infinite loop issue in
the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this
flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).

CVE-2015-5279 
Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw
in the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this
flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or
potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
privileges of the hosting QEMU process.

CVE-2015-6815 
Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered an infinite loop issue in
the e1000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this flaw
to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).

CVE-2015-6855 
Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a flaw in the IDE
subsystem in QEMU occurring while executing IDE's
WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX command to determine the maximum size of a
drive. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to mount a
denial of service (QEMU process crash).");
