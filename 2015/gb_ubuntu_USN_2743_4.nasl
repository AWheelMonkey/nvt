in some circumstances. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Andrew Osmond, Olli Pettay, Andrew Sutherland, Christian Holler, David
Major, Andrew McCreight, Cameron McCormack, Bob Clary and Randell Jesup
discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2015-4500, CVE-2015-4501)

Andr&#233  Bargull discovered that when a web page creates a scripted proxy
for the window with a handler defined a certain way, a reference to the
inner window will be passed, rather than that of the outer window.
(CVE-2015-4502)

Felix Gr&#246 bert discovered an out-of-bounds read in the QCMS color
management library in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or obtain
sensitive information. (CVE-2015-4504)

Khalil Zhani discovered a buffer overflow when parsing VP9 content in some
circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4506)

Spandan Veggalam discovered a crash while using the debugger API in some
circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website whilst using the debugger, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2015-4507)

Juho Nurminen discovered that the URL bar could display the wrong URL in
reader mode in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
conduct URL spoofing attacks. (CVE-2015-4508)

A use-after-free was discovered when manipulating HTML media content in
some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4509)
