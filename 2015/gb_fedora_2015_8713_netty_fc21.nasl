  script_tag(name: "insight", value: "Netty is a NIO client server framework
which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol
servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming
such as TCP and UDP socket server.

'Quick and easy' doesn't mean that a resulting application will suffer from a
maintainability or a performance issue. Netty has been designed carefully with
the experiences earned from the implementation of a lot of protocols such as FTP,
SMTP, HTTP, and various binary and text-based legacy protocols. As a result,
Netty has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance,
stability, and flexibility without a compromise.
