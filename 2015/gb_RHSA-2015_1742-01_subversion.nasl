  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Subversion (SVN) is a concurrent version control system which enables one
or more users to collaborate in developing and maintaining a hierarchy of
files and directories while keeping a history of all changes. The
mod_dav_svn module is used with the Apache HTTP Server to allow access
to Subversion repositories via HTTP.

An assertion failure flaw was found in the way the SVN server processed
certain requests with dynamically evaluated revision numbers. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to cause the SVN server (both svnserve and
httpd with the mod_dav_svn module) to crash. (CVE-2015-0248)

It was found that the mod_authz_svn module did not properly restrict
anonymous access to Subversion repositories under certain configurations
when used with Apache httpd 2.4.x. This could allow a user to anonymously
access files in a Subversion repository, which should only be accessible to
authenticated users. (CVE-2015-3184)

It was found that the mod_dav_svn module did not properly validate the
svn:author property of certain requests. An attacker able to create new
revisions could use this flaw to spoof the svn:author property.
(CVE-2015-0251)

It was found that when an SVN server (both svnserve and httpd with the
mod_dav_svn module) searched the history of a file or a directory, it would
disclose its location in the repository if that file or directory was not
readable (for example, if it had been moved). (CVE-2015-3187)

Red Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting
these issues. Upstream acknowledges Evgeny Kotkov of VisualSVN as the
original reporter of CVE-2015-0248 and CVE-2015-0251, and C. Michael
Pilato of CollabNet as the original reporter of CVE-2015-3184 and
CVE-2015-3187 flaws.

All subversion users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, for the update to take effect, you must restart the httpd
daemon, if you are using mod_dav_svn, and the svnserve daemon, if you are
serving Subversion repositories via the svn:// protocol.");
