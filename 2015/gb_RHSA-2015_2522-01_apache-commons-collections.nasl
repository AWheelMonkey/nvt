provides new interfaces, implementations, and utilities to extend the features

It was found that the Apache commons-collections library permitted code
execution when deserializing objects involving a specially constructed
chain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute
arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the
commons-collections library. (CVE-2015-7501)

With this update, deserialization of certain classes in the
commons-collections library is no longer allowed. Applications that require
those classes to be deserialized can use the system property
'org.apache.commons.collections.enableUnsafeSerialization' to re-enable
their deserialization.

Further information about this security flaw may be found at the linked references.

All users of apache-commons-collections are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
All running applications using the commons-collections library must be
restarted for the update to take effect.");
