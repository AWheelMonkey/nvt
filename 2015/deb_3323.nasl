CVE-2014-8146 
The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation does not properly
track directionally isolated pieces of text, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow)
or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted text.

CVE-2014-8147 
The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation uses an integer
data type that is inconsistent with a header file, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect malloc
followed by invalid free) or possibly execute arbitrary code via
crafted text.

CVE-2015-4760 
The Layout Engine was missing multiple boundary checks. These could
lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption. A specially crafted
file could cause an application using ICU to parse untrusted font
files to crash and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

Additionally, it was discovered that the patch applied to ICU in DSA-3187-1
for CVE-2014-6585 
was incomplete, possibly leading to an invalid memory
access. This could allow remote attackers to disclose portion of private
memory via crafted font files.");
