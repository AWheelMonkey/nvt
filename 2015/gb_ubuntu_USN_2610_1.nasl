in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to
bypass Same Origin Policy restrictions. (CVE-2015-1253, CVE-2015-1254)

A use-after-free was discovered in the WebAudio implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges
of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1255)

A use-after-free was discovered in the SVG implementation in Blink. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed
render process. (CVE-2015-1256)

A security issue was discovered in the SVG implementation in Blink. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer
crash. (CVE-2015-1257)

An issue was discovered with the build of libvpx. If a user were tricked
in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.
(CVE-2015-1258)

Multiple use-after-free issues were discovered in the WebRTC
implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to
cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1260)

An uninitialized value bug was discovered in the font shaping code in
Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,
an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service
via renderer crash. (CVE-2015-1262)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial
of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1265)

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked
in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via
renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-3910)");
