  script_tag(name: "insight", value: "Hive files are undocumented binary files that Windows uses to store the
Windows Registry on disk. Hivex is a library that can read and write to
these files.

It was found that hivex attempted to read beyond its allocated buffer when
reading a hive file with a very small size or with a truncated or
improperly formatted content. An attacker able to supply a specially
crafted hive file to an application using the hivex library could possibly
use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running that application. (CVE-2014-9273)

Red Hat would like to thank Mahmoud Al-Qudsi of NeoSmart Technologies for
reporting this issue.

The hivex package has been upgraded to upstream version 1.3.10, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
(BZ#1023978)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Due to an error in the hivex_value_data_cell_offset() function, the hivex
utility could, in some cases, print an 'Argument list is too long' message
and terminate unexpectedly when processing hive files from the Windows
Registry. This update fixes the underlying code and hivex now processes
hive files as expected. (BZ#1145056)

* A typographical error in the Win::Hivex.3pm manual page has been
corrected. (BZ#1099286)

Users of hivex are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues and adds these enhancements.
