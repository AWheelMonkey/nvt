It was discovered that libwmf did not correctly process certain WMF
(Windows Metafiles) with embedded BMP images. By tricking a victim into
opening a specially crafted WMF file in an application using libwmf, a
remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2015-0848,
CVE-2015-4588)

All users of libwmf are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
update, all applications using libwmf must be restarted for the update to
take effect.
