  * CVE-2014-3638: dbus-daemon tracks whether method call messages
  expect a reply, so that unsolicited replies can be dropped. As
  currently implemented, if there are n parallel method calls in
  progress, each method reply takes O(n) CPU time. A malicious user
  could exploit this by opening the maximum allowed number of parallel
  connections and sending the maximum number of parallel method calls
  on each one, causing subsequent method calls to be unreasonably
  slow, a denial of service.

  * CVE-2014-3639: dbus-daemon allows a small number of 'incomplete'
  connections (64 by default) whose identity has not yet been
  confirmed. When this limit has been reached, subsequent connections
  are dropped. Alban's testing indicates that one malicious process
  that makes repeated connection attempts, but never completes the
  authentication handshake and instead waits for dbus-daemon to time
  out and disconnect it, can cause the majority of legitimate
  connection attempts to fail.");
