  The following vulnerabilities were fixed:

  * CVE-2015-1931: IBM Java Security Components store plain text data in
  memory dumps, which could allow a local attacker to obtain information
  to aid in further attacks against the system.

  * CVE-2015-2590: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the Libraries
  component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via
  multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have
  resulted in unauthorized Operating System takeover including arbitrary
  code execution.

  * CVE-2015-2601: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the JCE component
  allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
  protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
  in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.

  * CVE-2015-2613: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the JCE component
  allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
  protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
  in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded
  accessible data.

  * CVE-2015-2619: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the 2D component
  allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
  protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
  in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.

  * CVE-2015-2621: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the JMX component
  allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
  protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
  in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.

  * CVE-2015-2625: Very difficult to exploit vulnerability in the JSSE
  component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via
  SSL/TLS. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in
  unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.

  * CVE-2015-2632: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the 2D component
  allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
  protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
  in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.

  * CVE-2015-2637: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the 2D component
  allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
  protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
