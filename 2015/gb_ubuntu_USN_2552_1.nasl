issue during anchor navigations in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin policy restrictions.
(CVE-2015-0801)

Christoph Kerschbaumer discovered that CORS requests from
navigator.sendBeacon() followed 30x redirections after preflight. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with
scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct
cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks. (CVE-2015-0807)

Aki Helin discovered a use-after-free when playing MP3 audio files using
the Fluendo MP3 GStreamer plugin in certain circumstances. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-0813)

Christian Holler, Steve Fink, and Byron Campen discovered multiple memory
safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-0815)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that documents loaded via resource: URLs (such
as PDF.js) could load privileged chrome pages. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker
could potentially exploit this in combination with another flaw, in order
to execute arbitrary script in a privileged context. (CVE-2015-0816)");
