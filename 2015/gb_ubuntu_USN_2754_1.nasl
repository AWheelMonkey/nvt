Sutherland, Christian Holler, David Major, Andrew McCreight, and Cameron
McCormack discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially
exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-4500)

Khalil Zhani discovered a buffer overflow when parsing VP9 content in some
circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
message, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-4506)

A use-after-free was discovered when manipulating HTML media content in
some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-4509)

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow in the nestegg library when
decoding WebM format video in some circumstances. If a user were tricked
in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-4511)

Ronald Crane reported multiple vulnerabilities. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker
could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-4517, CVE-2015-4521, CVE-2015-4522,
CVE-2015-7174, CVE-2015-7175, CVE-2015-7176, CVE-2015-7177, CVE-2015-7180)

Mario Gomes discovered that dragging and dropping an image after a
redirect exposes the redirected URL to scripts. An attacker could
potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2015-4519)

Ehsan Akhgari discovered 2 issues with CORS preflight requests. An
attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass CORS restrictions.
