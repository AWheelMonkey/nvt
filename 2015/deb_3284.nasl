these problems have been fixed in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u8. Only CVE-2015-3209

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.3+dfsg-6.

CVE-2015-3209 
Matt Tait of Google's Project Zero security team discovered a flaw
in the way QEMU's AMD PCnet Ethernet emulation handles multi-TMD
packets with a length above 4096 bytes. A privileged guest user in a
guest with an AMD PCNet ethernet card enabled can potentially use
this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges
of the hosting QEMU process.

CVE-2015-4037 
Kurt Seifried of Red Hat Product Security discovered that QEMU's
user mode networking stack uses predictable temporary file names
when the -smb option is used. An unprivileged user can use this flaw
to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2015-4103 
Jan Beulich of SUSE discovered that the QEMU Xen code does not
properly restrict write access to the host MSI message data field,
allowing a malicious guest to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2015-4104 
Jan Beulich of SUSE discovered that the QEMU Xen code does not
properly restrict access to PCI MSI mask bits, allowing a malicious
guest to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2015-4105 
Jan Beulich of SUSE reported that the QEMU Xen code enables
logging for PCI MSI-X pass-through error messages, allowing a
malicious guest to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2015-4106 
Jan Beulich of SUSE discovered that the QEMU Xen code does not
properly restrict write access to the PCI config space for certain
PCI pass-through devices, allowing a malicious guest to cause a
denial of service, obtain sensitive information or potentially
execute arbitrary code.");
