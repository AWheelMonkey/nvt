discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2014-8634, CVE-2014-8635)

Bobby Holley discovered that some DOM objects with certain properties
can bypass XrayWrappers in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to bypass security restrictions. (CVE-2014-8636)

Michal Zalewski discovered a use of uninitialized memory when rendering
malformed bitmap images on a canvas element. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to steal confidential information. (CVE-2014-8637)

Muneaki Nishimura discovered that requests from navigator.sendBeacon()
lack an origin header. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct
cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks. (CVE-2014-8638)

Xiaofeng Zheng discovered that a web proxy returning a 407 response
could inject cookies in to the originally requested domain. If a user
connected to a malicious web proxy, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to conduct session-fixation attacks. (CVE-2014-8639)

Holger Fuhrmannek discovered a crash in Web Audio while manipulating
timelines. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2014-8640)

Mitchell Harper discovered a use-after-free in WebRTC. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2014-8641)

Brian Smith discovered that OCSP responses would fail to verify if signed
by a delegated OCSP responder certificate with the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck
extension, potentially allowing a user to connect to a site with a revoked
certificate. (CVE-2014-8642)");
