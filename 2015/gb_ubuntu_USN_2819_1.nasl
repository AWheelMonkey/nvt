Tyson Smith, Boris Zbarsky, Randell Jesup, Olli Pettay, Karl Tomlinson, Jeff Walden,
and Gary Kwong discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-4513)

Tyson Smith and David Keeler discovered a use-after-poison and buffer
overflow in NSS. An attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-7181,
CVE-2015-7182)

Ryan Sleevi discovered an integer overflow in NSPR. An attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-7183)

Micha&#322  Bentkowski discovered that adding white-space to hostnames that are
IP addresses can bypass same-origin protections. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website in a browser-like context, an
attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks. (CVE-2015-7188)

Looben Yang discovered a buffer overflow during script interactions with
the canvas element in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website in a browser-like context, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-7189)

Shinto K Anto discovered that CORS preflight is bypassed when receiving
non-standard Content-Type headers in some circumstances. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browser-like
context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass
same-origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-7193)

Gustavo Grieco discovered a buffer overflow in libjar in some
circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website in a browser-like context, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
