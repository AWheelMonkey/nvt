    script_tag(name: "summary",   value: "Multiple vulnerabilities have been
discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Sockets Layer toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2014-3569
Frank Schmirler reported that the ssl23_get_client_hello function in
OpenSSL does not properly handle attempts to use unsupported
protocols. When OpenSSL is built with the no-ssl3 option and a SSL
v3 ClientHello is received, the ssl method would be set to NULL which
could later result in a NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash.

CVE-2014-3570
Pieter Wuille of Blockstream reported that the bignum squaring
(BN_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some platforms, which
might make it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
protection mechanisms.

CVE-2014-3571
Markus Stenberg of Cisco Systems, Inc. reported that a carefully
crafted DTLS message can cause a segmentation fault in OpenSSL due
to a NULL pointer dereference. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to mount a denial of service attack.

CVE-2014-3572
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that an
OpenSSL client would accept a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH
ciphersuite if the server key exchange message is omitted. This
allows remote SSL servers to conduct ECDHE-to-ECDH downgrade attacks
and trigger a loss of forward secrecy.

CVE-2014-8275
Antti Karjalainen and Tuomo Untinen of the Codenomicon CROSS project
and Konrad Kraszewski of Google reported various certificate
fingerprint issues, which allow remote attackers to defeat a
fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist protection mechanism.

CVE-2015-0204
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that
an OpenSSL client will accept the use of an ephemeral RSA key in a
non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite, violating the TLS
standard. This allows remote SSL servers to downgrade the security
of the session.

CVE-2015-0205
Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that an
OpenSSL server will accept a DH certificate for client
authentication without the certificate verify message. This flaw
effectively allows a client to authenticate without the use of a
private key via crafted TLS handshake protocol traffic to a server
that recognizes a certification authority with DH support.

CVE-2015-0206
Chris Mueller discovered a memory leak in the dtls1_buffer_record
function. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to mount a
denial of service through memory exhaustion by repeatedly sending
specially crafted DTLS records.");
