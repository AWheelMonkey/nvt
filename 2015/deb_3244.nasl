CVE-2015-3011Hugh Davenport discovered that the contacts

with ownCloud is vulnerable to multiple stored cross-site
scripting attacks. This vulnerability is effectively exploitable
in any browser.

CVE-2015-3012Roy Jansen discovered that the documents 
application shipped with
ownCloud is vulnerable to multiple stored cross-site scripting
attacks. This vulnerability is not exploitable in browsers that
support the current CSP standard.

CVE-2015-3013 
Lukas Reschke discovered a blacklist bypass vulnerability, allowing
authenticated remote attackers to bypass the file blacklist and
upload files such as the .htaccess files. An attacker could leverage
this bypass by uploading a .htaccess and execute arbitrary PHP code
if the /data/ directory is stored inside the web root and a web
server that interprets .htaccess files is used. On default Debian
installations the data directory is outside of the web root and thus
this vulnerability is not exploitable by default.");
