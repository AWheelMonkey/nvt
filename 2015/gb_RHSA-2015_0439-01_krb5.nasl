  script_tag(name: "insight", value: "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the MIT Kerberos SPNEGO
acceptor for continuation tokens. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could
use this flaw to crash a GSSAPI-enabled server application. (CVE-2014-4344)

A buffer overflow was found in the KADM5 administration server (kadmind)
when it was used with an LDAP back end for the KDC database. A remote,
authenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary
code on the system running kadmind. (CVE-2014-4345)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the MIT Kerberos libgssapi_krb5
library processed valid context deletion tokens. An attacker able to make
an application using the GSS-API library (libgssapi) call the
gss_process_context_token() function could use this flaw to crash that
application. (CVE-2014-5352)

If kadmind were used with an LDAP back end for the KDC database, a remote,
authenticated attacker with the permissions to set the password policy
could crash kadmind by attempting to use a named ticket policy object as a
password policy for a principal. (CVE-2014-5353)

A double-free flaw was found in the way MIT Kerberos handled invalid
External Data Representation (XDR) data. An authenticated user could use
this flaw to crash the MIT Kerberos administration server (kadmind), or
other applications using Kerberos libraries, using specially crafted XDR
packets. (CVE-2014-9421)

It was found that the MIT Kerberos administration server (kadmind)
incorrectly accepted certain authentication requests for two-component
server principal names. A remote attacker able to acquire a key with a
particularly named principal (such as 'kad/x') could use this flaw to
impersonate any user to kadmind, and perform administrative actions as that
user. (CVE-2014-9422)

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way MIT Kerberos RPCSEC_GSS
implementation (libgssrpc) handled certain requests. An attacker could send
a specially crafted request to an application using libgssrpc to disclose a
limited portion of uninitialized memory used by that application.
(CVE-2014-9423)

Two buffer over-read flaws were found in the way MIT Kerberos handled
certain requests. A remote, unauthenticated attacker able to inject packets
into a client or server application's GSSAPI session could use either of
these flaws to crash the application. (CVE-2014-4341, CVE-2014-4342)

A double-free flaw was found in the MIT Kerberos SPNEGO initiators. An
attacker able to spoof packets to appear as though they are from an GSSAPI
acceptor could use this flaw to crash a client application that uses MIT
Kerberos. (CVE-2014-4343)
