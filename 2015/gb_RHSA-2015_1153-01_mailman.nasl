It was found that mailman did not sanitize the list name before passing it
to certain MTAs. A local attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
code as the user running mailman. (CVE-2015-2775)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, it was impossible to configure Mailman in a way that
Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp  Conformance (DMARC) would
recognize Sender alignment for Domain Key Identified Mail (DKIM)
signatures. Consequently, Mailman list subscribers that belonged to a mail
server with a 'reject' policy for DMARC, such as yahoo.com or AOL.com, were
unable to receive Mailman forwarded messages from senders residing in any
domain that provided DKIM signatures. With this update, domains with a
'reject' DMARC policy are recognized correctly, and Mailman list
administrators are able to configure the way these messages are handled. As
a result, after a proper configuration, subscribers now correctly receive
Mailman forwarded messages in this scenario. (BZ#1229288)

  * Previously, the /etc/mailman file had incorrectly set permissions, which
in some cases caused removing Mailman lists to fail with a ''NoneType'
object has no attribute 'close'' message. With this update, the permissions
value for /etc/mailman is correctly set to 2775 instead of 0755, and
removing Mailman lists now works as expected. (BZ#1229307)

  * Prior to this update, the mailman utility incorrectly installed the
tmpfiles configuration in the /etc/tmpfiles.d/ directory. As a consequence,
changes made to mailman tmpfiles configuration were overwritten if the
mailman packages were reinstalled or updated. The mailman utility now
installs the tmpfiles configuration in the /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/ directory,
and changes made to them by the user are preserved on reinstall or update.
(BZ#1229306)

All mailman users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.");
