attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2015-1270)

A use-after-free was discovered in the GPU process implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1272)

A use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1276)

A use-after-free was discovered in the accessibility implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1277)

A memory corruption issue was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked
in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.
(CVE-2015-1280)

It was discovered that Blink did not properly determine the V8 context of
a microtask in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. (CVE-2015-1281)

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Expat. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
the program. (CVE-2015-1283)

It was discovered that Blink did not enforce a page's maximum number of
frames in some circumstances, resulting in a use-after-free. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,
or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render
process. (CVE-2015-1284)

It was discovered that the XSS auditor in Blink did not properly choose a
truncation point. If a user were tricked in to open ...
