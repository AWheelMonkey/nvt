For Debian 7 (wheezy) this update adds a missing part to make it actually
possible to disable client-initiated renegotiation and disables it by default
(CVE-2009-3555).
TLS compression is disabled (CVE-2012-4929),
although this is normally already disabled by the OpenSSL system library.
Finally it adds the ability to disable the SSLv3 protocol (CVE-2014-3566)
entirely via the new DisableSSLv3 
configuration directive, although it
will not disabled by default in this update. Additionally a non-security
sensitive issue in redirect encoding is
addressed.

For Debian 8 (jessie) these issues have been fixed prior to the release,
with the exception of client-initiated renegotiation (CVE-2009-3555 
).
This update addresses that issue for jessie.");
