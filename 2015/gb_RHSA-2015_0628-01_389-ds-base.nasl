  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages
include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and
command-line utilities for server administration.

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way the 389 Directory
Server stored information in the Changelog that is exposed via the
'cn=changelog' LDAP sub-tree. An unauthenticated user could in certain
cases use this flaw to read data from the Changelog, which could include
sensitive information such as plain-text passwords. (CVE-2014-8105)

This issue was discovered by Petr paek of the Red Hat Identity Management
Engineering Team.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * In multi-master replication (MMR), deleting a single-valued attribute of
a Directory Server (DS) entry was previously in some cases not correctly
replicated. Consequently, the entry state in the replica systems did not
reflect the intended changes. This bug has been fixed and the removal of a
single-valued attribute is now properly replicated. (BZ#1179099)

  * Prior to this update, the Directory Server (DS) always checked the ACI
syntax. As a consequence, removing an ACI failed with a syntax error.
With this update, the ACI check is stopped when the ACI is going to be
removed, and the removal thus works as expected. (BZ#1179100)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

  * The buffer size limit for the 389-ds-base application has been increased
to 2MB in order to match the buffer size limit of Simple Authentication and
Security Layer (SASL) and Basic Encoding Rules (BER). (BZ#1179595)

All 389-ds-base users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
enhancement. After installing this update, the 389 server service will be
restarted automatically.");
