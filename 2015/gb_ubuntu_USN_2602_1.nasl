Campen, Steve Fink, Gary Kwong, Andrew McCreight, Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard,
and Milan Sreckovic discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2015-2708, CVE-2015-2709)

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow during the rendering of SVG
