* A flaw was found in the way seunshare, a utility for running executables
under a different security context, used the capng_lock functionality of
the libcap-ng library. The subsequent invocation of suid root binaries that
relied on the fact that the setuid() system call, among others, also sets
the saved set-user-ID when dropping the binaries' process privileges, could
allow a local, unprivileged user to potentially escalate their privileges
on the system. Note: the fix for this issue is the kernel part of the
overall fix, and introduces the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS functionality and the
related SELinux exec transitions support. (CVE-2014-3215, Important)

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP
implementation handled authentication key reference counting during INIT
collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1421,
Important)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM implementation did not ensure
that the host CR4 control register value remained unchanged across VM
entries on the same virtual CPU. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2014-3690, Moderate)

* An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the syscall tracing
functionality of the Linux kernel's perf subsystem. A local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2014-7825, Moderate)

* An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the syscall tracing
functionality of the Linux kernel's ftrace subsystem. On a system with
ftrace syscall tracing enabled, a local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to crash the system, or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2014-7826,
Moderate)

* It was found that the Linux kernel memory resource controller's (memcg)
handling of OOM (out of memory) conditions could lead to deadlocks.
An attacker able to continuously spawn new processes within a single
memory-constrained cgroup during an OOM event could use this flaw to lock
up the system. (CVE-2014-8171, Moderate)

* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel keys
management subsystem performed key garbage collection. A local attacker
could attempt accessing a key while it was being garbage collected, which
would cause the system to crash. (CVE-2014-9529, Moderate)

* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the TechnoTrend/Hauppauge
DEC USB device driver. A local user with write access to the corresponding
device could use this flaw to crash ...
