CVE-2015-6658 
The form autocomplete functionality did not properly sanitize the
requested URL, allowing remote attackers to perform a cross-site
scripting attack.

CVE-2015-6659 
The SQL comment filtering system could allow a user with elevated
permissions to inject malicious code in SQL comments.

CVE-2015-6660 
The form API did not perform form token validation early enough,
allowing the file upload callbacks to be run with untrusted input.
This could allow remote attackers to upload files to the site under
another user's account.

CVE-2015-6661Users without the access content 
permission could see the titles
of nodes that they do not have access to, if the nodes were added to
a menu on the site that the users have access to.

CVE-2015-6665 
Remote attackers could perform a cross-site scripting attack by
invoking Drupal.ajax() on a whitelisted HTML element.");
