1. Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Command Injection

A vulnerability in the web framework in the Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS)
could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed
user privilege ''nobody''.

2. Expressway user creds can be changed without providing current password

A vulnerability in the Password Change functionality in the Administrative Web Interface of the Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server
(VCS) Expressway could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to make unauthorized changes to user passwords.

3. Password hashes are recorded to the Expressway Configuration Log

A vulnerability in Configuration Log File of the Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Expressway could allow an authenticated,
remote attacker to obtain sensitive information stored on an affected system.

4. SIP Proxy-Authorization user not checked against phone line

A vulnerability in of the Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Expressway could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to falsely
register their Mobile and Remote Access (MRA) endpoint.

5. XCP ConnectionManager segfaults on malformed auth message

A vulnerability in the Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Expressway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a
denial of service (DoS) condition.

6. Traffic Server segfault on memcpy() from malformed GET request

A vulnerability in the Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Expressway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a
denial of service (DoS) condition.
