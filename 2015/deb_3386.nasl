CVE-2015-7696

password protected archives. If a user or automated system were
tricked into processing a specially crafted zip archive, an attacker
could possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2015-7697

malformed archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into
processing a specially crafted zip archive, an attacker could
possibly cause unzip to hang, resulting in a denial of service.");
