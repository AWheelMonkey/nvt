CVE-2015-3214 
Matt Tait of Google's Project Zero security team discovered a flaw
in the QEMU i8254 PIT emulation. A privileged guest user in a guest
with QEMU PIT emulation enabled could potentially use this flaw to
execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the
hosting QEMU process.

CVE-2015-5154 
Kevin Wolf of Red Hat discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw in the
IDE subsystem in QEMU while processing certain ATAPI commands. A
privileged guest user in a guest with the CDROM drive enabled could
potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with
the privileges of the hosting QEMU process.

CVE-2015-5165 
Donghai Zhu discovered that the QEMU model of the RTL8139 network
card did not sufficiently validate inputs in the C+ mode offload
emulation, allowing a malicious guest to read uninitialized memory
from the QEMU process's heap.

CVE-2015-5225 
Mr Qinghao Tang from QIHU 360 Inc. and Mr Zuozhi from Alibaba Inc
discovered a buffer overflow flaw in the VNC display driver leading
to heap memory corruption. A privileged guest user could use this
flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or
potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
privileges of the hosting QEMU process.

CVE-2015-5745 
A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the way QEMU
handles the virtio-serial device. A malicious guest could use this
flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).");
