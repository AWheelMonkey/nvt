Original advisory details:

Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Tyson Smith, Bobby Holley,
Chris Coulson, and Eric Rahm discovered multiple memory safety issues in
Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,
an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service
via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4473, CVE-2015-4474)

Aki Helin discovered an out-of-bounds read when playing malformed MP3
content in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2015-4475)

A use-after-free was discovered during MediaStream playback in some
circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4477)

Andr&#233  Bargull discovered that non-configurable properties on javascript
objects could be redefined when parsing JSON. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to bypass same-origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-4478)

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in libstagefright. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2015-4479, CVE-2015-4480, CVE-2015-4493)

Jukka Jyl&#228 nki discovered a crash that occurs because javascript does not
properly gate access to Atomics or SharedArrayBuffers in some
circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service. (CVE-2015-4484)

Abhishek Arya discovered 2 buffer overflows in libvpx when decoding
malformed WebM content in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
