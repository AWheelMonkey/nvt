the Identity Management web administrative interface, and could allow an

Note: The IdM version provided by this update no longer uses jQuery.

Bug fixes:

  * The ipa-server-install, ipa-replica-install, and ipa-client-install
utilities are not supported on machines running in FIPS-140 mode.
Previously, IdM did not warn users about this. Now, IdM does not allow
running the utilities in FIPS-140 mode, and displays an explanatory
message. (BZ#1131571)

  * If an Active Directory (AD) server was specified or discovered
automatically when running the ipa-client-install utility, the utility
produced a traceback instead of informing the user that an IdM server is
expected in this situation. Now, ipa-client-install detects the AD server
and fails with an explanatory message. (BZ#1132261)

  * When IdM servers were configured to require the TLS protocol version 1.1
(TLSv1.1) or later in the httpd server, the ipa utility failed. With this
update, running ipa works as expected with TLSv1.1 or later. (BZ#1154687)

  * In certain high-load environments, the Kerberos authentication step of
the IdM client installer can fail. Previously, the entire client
installation failed in this situation. This update modifies
ipa-client-install to prefer the TCP protocol over the UDP protocol and to
retry the authentication attempt in case of failure. (BZ#1161722)

  * If ipa-client-install updated or created the /etc/nsswitch.conf file, the
sudo utility could terminate unexpectedly with a segmentation fault. Now,
ipa-client-install puts a new line character at the end of nsswitch.conf if
it modifies the last line of the file, fixing this bug. (BZ#1185207)

  * The ipa-client-automount utility failed with the 'UNWILLING_TO_PERFORM'
LDAP error when the nsslapd-minssf Red Hat Directory Server configuration
parameter was set to '1'. This update modifies ipa-client-automount to use
encrypted connection for LDAP searches by default, and the utility now
finishes successfully even with nsslapd-minssf specified. (BZ#1191040)

  * If installing an IdM server failed after the Certificate Authority (CA)
installation, the 'ipa-server-install --uninstall' command did not perform
a proper cleanup. After the user issued 'ipa-server-install --uninstall'
and then attempted to install the server again, the installation failed.
Now, 'ipa-server-install --uninst ...
