that manages network devices and connections.

It was discovered that NetworkManager would set device MTUs based on MTU
values received in IPv6 RAs (Router Advertisements), without sanity
checking the MTU value first. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to
create a denial of service attack, by sending a specially crafted IPv6 RA
packet to disturb IPv6 communication. (CVE-2015-0272)

A flaw was found in the way NetworkManager handled router advertisements.
An unprivileged user on a local network could use IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
ICMP to broadcast a non-route with a low hop limit, causing machines to
lower the hop limit on existing IPv6 routes. If this limit is small enough,
IPv6 packets would be dropped before reaching the final destination.
(CVE-2015-2924)

The network-manager-applet and NetworkManager-libreswan packages have been
upgraded to upstream versions 1.0.6, and provide a number of bug fixes and
enhancements over the previous versions. (BZ#1177582, BZ#1243057)

Bugs:

  * It was not previously possible to set the Wi-Fi band to the 'a' or 'bg'
values to lock to a specific frequency band. NetworkManager has been fixed,
and it now sets the wpa_supplicant's 'freq_list' option correctly, which
enables proper Wi-Fi band locking. (BZ#1254461)

  * NetworkManager immediately failed activation of devices that did not have
a carrier early in the boot process. The legacy network.service then
reported activation failure. Now, NetworkManager has a grace period during
which it waits for the carrier to appear. Devices that have a carrier down
for a short time on system startup no longer cause the legacy
network.service to fail. (BZ#1079353)

  * NetworkManager brought down a team device if the teamd service managing
it exited unexpectedly, and the team device was deactivated. Now,
NetworkManager respawns the teamd instances that disappear and is able to
recover from a teamd failure avoiding disruption of the team device
operation. (BZ#1145988)

  * NetworkManager did not send the FQDN DHCP option even if host name was
set to FQDN. Consequently, Dynamic DNS (DDNS) setups failed to update the
DNS records for clients running NetworkManager. Now, NetworkManager sends
the FQDN option with DHCP requests, and the DHCP server is able to create
DNS records for such clients. (BZ#1212597)

  * The command-line client was not validating the vlan.flags property
correctly, and a spurious warning message was displayed when the nmcli tool
worked with VLAN connections. The validation routine has been fixed, and
the warning message no longer app ...
