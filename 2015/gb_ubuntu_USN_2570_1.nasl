in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an
attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.
(CVE-2015-1235)

An issue was discovered in the Web Audio API implementation in Blink. If
a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.
(CVE-2015-1236)

A use-after-free was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1237)

An out-of-bounds write was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
(CVE-2015-1238)

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the WebGL implementation. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer
crash. (CVE-2015-1240)

An issue was discovered with the interaction of page navigation and touch
event handling. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct
'tap jacking' attacks. (CVE-2015-1241)

A type confusion bug was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1242)

It was discovered that websocket connections were not upgraded whenever a
HSTS policy is active. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this
to conduct a man in the middle (MITM) attack. (CVE-2015-1244)

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash.
(CVE-2015-1246)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial
of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1249)
