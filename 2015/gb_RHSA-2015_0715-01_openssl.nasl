An invalid pointer use flaw was found in OpenSSL's ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
function. A remote attacker could crash a TLS/SSL client or server using
OpenSSL via a specially crafted X.509 certificate when the
attacker-supplied certificate was verified by the application.
(CVE-2015-0286)

An integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the
way OpenSSL decoded malformed Base64-encoded inputs. An attacker able to
make an application using OpenSSL decode a specially crafted Base64-encoded
input (such as a PEM file) could use this flaw to cause the application to
crash. Note: this flaw is not exploitable via the TLS/SSL protocol because
the data being transferred is not Base64-encoded. (CVE-2015-0292)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled SSLv2
handshake messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a
TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL to exit on a failed assertion if it had both
the SSLv2 protocol and EXPORT-grade cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2015-0293)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL imported malformed
Elliptic Curve private keys. A specially crafted key file could cause an
application using OpenSSL to crash when imported. (CVE-2015-0209)

An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way OpenSSL reused certain
ASN.1 structures. A remote attacker could possibly use a specially crafted
ASN.1 structure that, when parsed by an application, would cause that
application to crash. (CVE-2015-0287)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in OpenSSL's X.509 certificate
handling implementation. A specially crafted X.509 certificate could cause
an application using OpenSSL to crash if the application attempted to
convert the certificate to a certificate request. (CVE-2015-0288)

A NULL pointer dereference was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain
PKCS#7 inputs. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL
verify, decrypt, or parse a specially crafted PKCS#7 input could cause that
application to crash. TLS/SSL clients and servers using OpenSSL were not
affected by this flaw. (CVE-2015-0289)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting
CVE-2015-0286, CVE-2015-0287, CVE-2015-0288, CVE-2015-0289, CVE-2015-0292,
and CVE-2015-0293. Upstream acknowledges Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL
development team as the original repor ...
