# For those who wish to go digging, please note that this is potentially
# the second time nmap will be launched with -sV (service identification)
# parameters.  The first timeout can be in "nmap.nasl". We cannot, however,
# rely on that pass for a number of reasons:
#    1. We may not be running that port scanner.
#    2. We only want to run AFTER find_service* scripts have executed,
#       along with a whole host of other specialty service identification
#       scripts. Our objective is to minimize nmap service identification
#       execution time, and only run it on services that remain unidentified
