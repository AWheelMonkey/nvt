   Experts in computer security, such as SANS Institute, and the members of the
   comp.os.linux.security newsgroup recommend that the use of Telnet for remote
   logins should be discontinued under all normal circumstances, for the following
   reasons:

  * Telnet, by default, does not encrypt any data sent over the connection
     (including passwords), and so it is often practical to eavesdrop on the
     communications and use the password later for malicious purposes. Anybody who
     has access to a router, switch, hub or gateway located on the network between
     the two hosts where Telnet is being used can intercept the packets passing by
     and obtain login and password information (and whatever else is typed) with any
     of several common utilities like tcpdump and Wireshark.

  * Most implementations of Telnet have no authentication that would ensure
     communication is carried out between the two desired hosts and not intercepted
     in the middle.

  * Commonly used Telnet daemons have several vulnerabilities discovered over
     the years.");
