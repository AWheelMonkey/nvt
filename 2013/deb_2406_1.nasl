variant of the Mozilla Thunderbird code base.

CVE-2011-3670Icedove does not not properly enforce the IPv6 literal address
syntax, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information by making XMLHttpRequest calls through a proxy and
reading the error messages.

CVE-2012-0442Memory corruption bugs could cause Icedove to crash or
possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-0444Icedove does not properly initialize nsChildView data
structures, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code via a crafted Ogg Vorbis file.

CVE-2012-0449Icedove allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code via a malformed XSLT stylesheet that is
embedded in a document.";
