developing web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and
responses in the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the
API for web servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the
so-called middleware) into a single method call.";
tag_solution  = "For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0-4+squeeze1.

The stable, testing and unstable distributions do not contain the
librack-ruby package. They have already been addressed in version
1.4.1-2.1 of the ruby-rack package.

We recommend that you upgrade your librack-ruby packages.";
tag_summary   = "Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Rack, a modular Ruby
webserver interface. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2011-5036 
Rack computes hash values for form parameters without restricting
the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
by sending many crafted parameters.

CVE-2013-0183 
A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (memory
consumption and out-of-memory error) via a long string in a
Multipart HTTP packet.

CVE-2013-0184 
A vulnerability in Rack::Auth::AbstractRequest allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-0263 
Rack::Session::Cookie allows remote attackers to guess the
session cookie, gain privileges, and execute arbitrary code via a
timing attack involving an HMAC comparison function that does not
run in constant time.";
