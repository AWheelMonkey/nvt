  A failure to validate input was discovered in the Linux kernel's Xen
  netback (network backend) driver. A user in a guest OS may exploit this
  flaw to cause a denial of service to the guest OS and other guest domains.

  A memory leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Xen netback (network
  backend) driver. A user in a guest OS could trigger this flaw to cause a
  denial of service on the system. (CVE-2013-0217)

  A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel Xen PCI backend driver. If a PCI
  device is assigned to the guest OS, the guest OS could exploit this flaw to
  cause a denial of service on the host. (CVE-2013-0231)

  A flaw was reported in the permission checks done by the Linux kernel for
  /dev/cpu/*/msr. A local root user with all capabilities dropped could
  exploit this flaw to execute code with full root capabilities.
  (CVE-2013-0268)

  Tommi Rantala discovered a flaw in the a flaw the Linux kernels handling of
  datagrams packets when the MSG_PEEK flag is specified. An unprivileged
  local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system
  hang). (CVE-2013-0290)

  A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's vhost driver used to accelerate
  guest networking in KVM based virtual machines. A privileged guest user
  could exploit this flaw to crash the host system. (CVE-2013-0311)

  A flaw was discovered in the Extended Verification Module (EVM) of the
  Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user code exploit this flaw to cause a
  denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-0313)

  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack
  when HIDP (Human Interface Device Protocol) support is enabled. A local
  unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak from
  the kernel. (CVE-2013-0349)");
