tag_insight = "The gnome-vfs2 packages provide the GNOME Virtual File System, which is the
  foundation of the Nautilus file manager. neon is an HTTP and WebDAV client
  library embedded in the gnome-vfs2 packages.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the neon Extensible Markup Language
  (XML) parser. Visiting a malicious DAV server with an application using
  gnome-vfs2 (such as Nautilus) could possibly cause the application to
  consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2009-2473)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * When extracted from the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), gnome-vfs2
  returned escaped file paths. If a path, as stored in the URI,
  contained non-ASCII characters or ASCII characters which are parsed as
  something other than a file path (for example, spaces), the escaped path
  was inaccurate. Consequently, files with the described type of URI could
  not be processed. With this update, gnome-vfs2 properly unescapes paths
  that are required for a system call. As a result, these paths are parsed
  properly. (BZ#580855)

  * In certain cases, the trash info file was populated by foreign
  entries, pointing to live data. Emptying the trash caused an accidental
  deletion of valuable data. With this update, a workaround has been applied
  in order to prevent the deletion. As a result, the accidental data loss is
  prevented, however further information is still gathered to fully fix this
  problem. (BZ#586015)
  ClearCase. This behavior significantly slowed down file operations. With
  this update, the unnecessary stat() operations have been limited. As a
  result, gnome-vfs2 user interfaces, such as Nautilus, are more responsive.
  (BZ#822817)

  All gnome-vfs2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
