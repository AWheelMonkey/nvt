This update fixes the following security issues:

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the madvise() system call
implementation in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2012-3511, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite
implementation handled IPv6 sockets that used the UDP_CORK option. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2013-4162, Moderate)

  * An information leak flaw in the Linux kernel could allow a local,
unprivileged user to leak kernel memory to user-space. (CVE-2013-2141, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Hannes Frederic Sowa for reporting
CVE-2013-4162.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * A bug in the be2net driver prevented communication between NICs using
be2net. This update applies a patch addressing this problem along with
several other upstream patches that fix various other problems. Traffic
between NICs using the be2net driver now proceeds as expected. (BZ#983864)

  * A recent patch fixing a problem that prevented communication between
NICs using the be2net driver caused the firmware of NICs to become
unresponsive, and thus triggered a kernel panic. The problem was caused by
unnecessary usage of a hardware workaround that allows skipping VLAN tag
insertion. A patch has been applied and the workaround is now used only
when the multi-channel configuration is enabled on the NIC. Note that the
bug only affected the NICs with firmware version 4.2.xxxx. (BZ#999819)

  * A bug in the autofs4 mount expiration code could cause the autofs4
module to falsely report a busy tree of NFS mounts as 'not in use'.
Consequently, automount attempted to unmount the tree and failed with
a 'failed to umount offset' error, leaving the mount tree to appear as
empty directories. A patch has been applied to remove an incorrectly used
autofs dentry mount check and the aforementioned problem no longer occurs.
(BZ#1001488)

  * A race condition in the be_open function in the be2net driver could
trigger the BUG_ON() macro, which resulted in a kernel panic. A patch
addressing this problem has been applied and the race condition is now
avoided by enabling polling before enabling interrupts globally. The
kernel no longer panics in this situation. (BZ#1005239)

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.");
