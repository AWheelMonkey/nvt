tag_insight = "Wireshark, previously known as Ethereal, is a network protocol analyzer. It
  is used to capture and browse the traffic running on a computer network.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Wireshark handled
  Endace ERF (Extensible Record Format) capture files. If Wireshark opened a
  specially-crafted ERF capture file, it could crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark. (CVE-2011-4102)

  Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
  crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
  opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2011-1958, CVE-2011-1959, CVE-2011-2175,
  CVE-2011-2698, CVE-2012-0041, CVE-2012-0042, CVE-2012-0066, CVE-2012-0067,
  CVE-2012-4285, CVE-2012-4289, CVE-2012-4290, CVE-2012-4291)

  The CVE-2011-1958, CVE-2011-1959, CVE-2011-2175, and CVE-2011-4102 issues
  were discovered by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response
  Team.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * When Wireshark starts with the X11 protocol being tunneled through an SSH
  connection, it automatically prepares its capture filter to omit the SSH
  packets. If the SSH connection was to a link-local IPv6 address including
  an interface name (for example ssh -X [ipv6addr]%eth0), Wireshark parsed
  this address erroneously, constructed an incorrect capture filter and
  refused to capture packets. The &quot;Invalid capture filter&quot; message was
  displayed. With this update, parsing of link-local IPv6 addresses is fixed
  and Wireshark correctly prepares a capture filter to omit SSH packets over
  a link-local IPv6 connection. (BZ#438473)
