tag_insight = "Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.

  Applications connect to the local Tor proxy using the SOCKS protocol. The
  local proxy chooses a path through a set of relays, in which each relay
  knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing down
  the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each relay, which reveals
  the downstream relay.

  Warnings: Tor does no protocol cleaning.  That means there is a danger
  that application protocols and associated programs can be induced to
  reveal information about the initiator. Tor depends on Privoxy and
  similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. This is alpha code,
  and is even more likely than released code to have anonymity-spoiling
  bugs. The present network is very small -- this further reduces the
  strength of the anonymity provided. Tor is not presently suitable for
  high-stakes anonymity.";
