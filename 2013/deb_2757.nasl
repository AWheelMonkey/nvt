For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.";
tag_summary   = "Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and specific
fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to upgrade the
Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead of backporting
the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way. We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.

CVE-2013-4338 
Unsafe PHP unserialization in wp-includes/functions.php could cause
arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2013-4339 
Insufficient input validation could result in redirecting or leading
a user to another website.

CVE-2013-4340 
Privilege escalation allowing an user with an author role to create
an entry appearing as written by another user.

CVE-2013-5738 
Insufficient capabilities were required for uploading .html/.html
files, making it easier for authenticated users to conduct cross-site
scripting attacks (XSS) using crafted html file uploads.

CVE-2013-5739 
Default Wordpress configuration allowed file upload for .swf/.exe
files, making it easier for authenticated users to conduct cross-site
scripting attacks (XSS).";
