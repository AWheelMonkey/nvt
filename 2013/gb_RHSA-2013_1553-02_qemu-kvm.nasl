  tag_insight = "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems that is built into the standard Red Hat
Enterprise Linux kernel. The qemu-kvm packages form the user-space
component for running virtual machines using KVM.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU processed the SCSI 'REPORT
LUNS' command when more than 256 LUNs were specified for a single SCSI
target. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU process
memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code
execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
(CVE-2013-4344)

This issue was discovered by Asias He of Red Hat.

These updated qemu-kvm packages include numerous bug fixes and various
enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Technical
Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant
of these changes.

All qemu-kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements. After installing this update, shut down all running virtual
machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for
this update to take effect.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258

5. Bugs fixed (https://bugzilla.redhat.com):
