  discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user
  were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could
  possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash.
  (CVE-2013-0783, CVE-2013-0784)

  Atte Kettunen discovered that Firefox could perform an out-of-bounds read
  while rendering GIF format images. An attacker could exploit this to crash
  Firefox. (CVE-2013-0772)

  Boris Zbarsky discovered that Firefox did not properly handle some wrapped
  WebIDL objects. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted
  page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service
  via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of
  the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0765)

  Bobby Holley discovered vulnerabilities in Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) and
  System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user were tricked into opening a specially
  crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass security
  protections to obtain sensitive information or potentially execute code
  with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0773)

  Frederik Braun that Firefox made the location of the active browser profile
  available to JavaScript workers. (CVE-2013-0774)

  A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Firefox. An attacker could
  potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user
  invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0775)

  Michal Zalewski discovered that Firefox would not always show the correct
  address when cancelling a proxy authentication prompt. A remote attacker
  could exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and phishing attacks.
  (CVE-2013-0776)

  Abhishek Arya discovered several problems related to memory handling. If
  the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker
  could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
  crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
  Firefox. (CVE-2013-0777, CVE-2013-0778, CVE-2013-0779, CVE-2013-0780,
