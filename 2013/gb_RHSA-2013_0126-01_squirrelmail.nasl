  The SquirrelMail security update RHSA-2012:0103 did not, unlike the erratum
  text stated, correct the CVE-2010-2813 issue, a flaw in the way
  SquirrelMail handled failed log in attempts. A user preference file was
  created when attempting to log in with a password containing an 8-bit
  character, even if the username was not valid. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to eventually consume all hard disk space on the target
  SquirrelMail server. (CVE-2012-2124)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, SquirrelMail could not decode multi-line subjects
  properly. Consequently, the decode header internationalization option did
  not properly handle new lines or tabs at the beginning of the lines. This
  bug has been fixed and SquirrelMail now works correctly in the described
  scenario. (BZ#241861)

  * Due to a bug, attachments written in HTML code on the Windows operating
  system were not displayed properly when accessed with SquirrelMail; the
  &quot;!=null&quot; string was trimmed to '!ull'. This bug has been fixed and the
  attachments are now displayed correctly in such a case. (BZ#359791)

  * Previously, e-mail messages with a Unique Identifier (UID) larger than
  2^31 bytes were unreadable when using the squirrelmail package. With this
  patch the squirrelmail package is able to read all messages regardless of
  the UIDs size. (BZ#450780)

  * Due to a bug, a PHP script did not assign the proper character set to
  requested variables. Consequently, SquirrelMail could not display any
  e-mails. The underlying source code has been modified and now the
  squirrelmail package assigns the correct character set. (BZ#475188)
