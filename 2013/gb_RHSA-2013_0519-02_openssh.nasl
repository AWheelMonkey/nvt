tag_insight = "OpenSSH is OpenBSD's Secure Shell (SSH) protocol implementation. These
  packages include the core files necessary for the OpenSSH client and
  server.

  Due to the way the pam_ssh_agent_auth PAM module was built in Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6, the glibc's error() function was called rather than the
  intended error() function in pam_ssh_agent_auth to report errors. As these
  two functions expect different arguments, it was possible for an attacker
  to cause an application using pam_ssh_agent_auth to crash, disclose
  portions of its memory or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2012-5536)

  Note that the pam_ssh_agent_auth module is not used in Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6 by default.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * All possible options for the new RequiredAuthentications directive were
  not documented in the sshd_config man page. This update improves the man
  page to document all the possible options. (BZ#821641)

  * When stopping one instance of the SSH daemon (sshd), the sshd init script
  (/etc/rc.d/init.d/sshd) stopped all sshd processes regardless of the PID of
  the processes. This update improves the init script so that it only kills
  processes with the relevant PID. As a result, the init script now works
  more reliably in a multi-instance environment. (BZ#826720)

  * Due to a regression, the ssh-copy-id command returned an exit status code
  of zero even if there was an error in copying the key to a remote host.
  With this update, a patch has been applied and ssh-copy-id now returns a
  non-zero exit code if there is an error in copying the SSH certificate to a
  remote host. (BZ#836650)

  * When SELinux was disabled on the system, no on-disk policy was installed,
  a user account was used for a connection, and no ~/.ssh configuration was
  present in that user's home directory, the SSH client terminated
  unexpectedly with a segmentation fault when attempting to connect to
  another system. A patch has been provided to address this issue and the
  crashes no longer occur in the described scenario. (BZ#836655)

  * The HOWTO document /usr/share/doc/openssh-ldap-5.3p1/HOWTO.ldap-keys
  incorrectly documented the use of the AuthorizedKeysCommand directive.
  This update corrects the document. (BZ#857760)

  This update also adds the following enhancements:

  * When attempting to enable SSH for use with a Common Access Card (CAC),
  the ssh-agent utility read all the certificates in th ...
