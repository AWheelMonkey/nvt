  A weakness was found in the way IPA clients communicated with IPA servers
  when initially attempting to join IPA domains. As there was no secure way
  to provide the IPA server's Certificate Authority (CA) certificate to the
  client during a join, the IPA client enrollment process was susceptible to
  man-in-the-middle attacks. This flaw could allow an attacker to obtain
  access to the IPA server using the credentials provided by an IPA client,
  including administrative access to the entire domain if the join was
  performed using an administrator's credentials. (CVE-2012-5484)

  Note: This weakness was only exposed during the initial client join to the
  realm, because the IPA client did not yet have the CA certificate of the
  server. Once an IPA client has joined the realm and has obtained the CA
  certificate of the IPA server, all further communication is secure. If a
  client were using the OTP (one-time password) method to join to the realm,
  an attacker could only obtain unprivileged access to the server (enough to
  only join the realm).

  Red Hat would like to thank Petr Menk for reporting this issue.

  This update must be installed on both the IPA client and IPA server. When
  this update has been applied to the client but not the server,
  ipa-client-install, in unattended mode, will fail if you do not have the
  correct CA certificate locally, noting that you must use the '--force'
  option to insecurely obtain the certificate. In interactive mode, the
  certificate will try to be obtained securely from LDAP. If this fails, you
  will be prompted to insecurely download the certificate via HTTP. In the
  same situation when using OTP, LDAP will not be queried and you will be
  prompted to insecurely download the certificate via HTTP.

  Users of ipa are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. After installing the update, changes in LDAP are
  handled by ipa-ldap-updater automatically and are effective immediately.");
