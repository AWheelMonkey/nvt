It is used to capture and browse the traffic running on a computer network.

Two flaws were found in Wireshark. If Wireshark read a malformed packet off
a network or opened a malicious dump file, it could crash or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark. (CVE-2013-3559,
CVE-2013-4083)

Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2012-2392, CVE-2012-3825, CVE-2012-4285,

The wireshark packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.8.10, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous versions.
For more information on the bugs fixed, enhancements included, and
supported protocols introduced, refer to the Wireshark Release Notes,
linked to in the References. (BZ#711024)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, Wireshark did not parse the RECLAIM-COMPLETE opcode when
inspecting traffic generated by NFSv4.1. A patch has been provided to
enable the parsing of the RECLAIM_COMPLETE opcode, and Wireshark is now
able to properly dissect and handle NFSv4.1 traffic. (BZ#750712)

  * Prior to this update, frame arrival times in a text file were reported
one hour ahead from the timestamps in the packet capture file.
This resulted in various failures being reported by the dfilter-test.py
test suite. To fix this bug, frame arrival timestamps have been shifted by
one hour, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#832021)

  * The 'tshark -D' command returned output to STDERR instead of STDOUT,
which could break scripts that are parsing the 'tshark -D' output. This bug
has been fixed, and the 'tshark -D' command now writes output data to a
correct standard stream. (BZ#1004636)

  * Due to an array overrun, Wireshark could experience undefined program
behavior or could unexpectedly terminate. With this update, proper array
handling ensures Wireshark no longer crashes in the described scenario.
(BZ#715560)

  * Previously, the dftest and randpkt command line util ...
