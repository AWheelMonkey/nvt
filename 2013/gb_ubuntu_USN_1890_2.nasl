  We apologize for the inconvenience.

  Original advisory details:

  Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were
  tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly
  exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
  potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
  Firefox. (CVE-2013-1682, CVE-2013-1683)

  Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free bugs. If the user were
  tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly
  exploit these to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-1684, CVE-2013-1685, CVE-2013-1686)

  Mariusz Mlynski discovered that user defined code within the XBL scope of
  an element could be made to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW). An attacker
  could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-1687)

  Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the profiler user interface incorrectly
  handled data from the profiler. If the user examined profiler output
  on a specially crafted page, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
  (CVE-2013-1688)

  A crash was discovered when reloading a page that contained content using
  the onreadystatechange event. An attacker could potentially exploit this
  to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox
  (CVE-2013-1690)

  Johnathan Kuskos discovered that Firefox sent data in the body of
  XMLHttpRequest HEAD requests. An attacker could exploit this to conduct
  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. (CVE-2013-1692)

  Paul Stone discovered a timing flaw in the processing of SVG images with
  filters. An attacker could exploit this to view sensitive information.
  (CVE-2013-1693)

  Boris Zbarsky discovered a flaw in PreserveWrapper. An attacker could
  potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
  crash, or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
  (CVE-2013-1694)

  Bob Owen discovered that a sandboxed iframe could use a frame element
  to bypass its own restrictions. (CVE-2013-1695)

  Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header is ignored in
  multi-part respo ...
