  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The httpd packages contain the Apache HTTP Server (httpd), which is the
  namesake project of The Apache Software Foundation.

  Input sanitization flaws were found in the mod_negotiation module. A remote
  attacker able to upload or create files with arbitrary names in a directory
  that has the MultiViews options enabled, could use these flaws to conduct
  cross-site scripting and HTTP response splitting attacks against users
  visiting the site. (CVE-2008-0455, CVE-2008-0456, CVE-2012-2687)

  Bug fixes:

  * Previously, no check was made to see if the
  /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key file was a valid key prior to running
  the '%post' script for the 'mod_ssl' package. Consequently, when
  /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt did not exist and 'localhost.key' was
  present but invalid, upgrading the Apache HTTP Server daemon (httpd) with
  mod_ssl failed. The '%post' script has been fixed to test for an existing
  SSL key. As a result, upgrading httpd with mod_ssl now proceeds as
  expected. (BZ#752618)

  * The 'mod_ssl' module did not support operation under FIPS mode.
  Consequently, when operating Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 with FIPS mode
  enabled, httpd failed to start. An upstream patch has been applied to
  disable non-FIPS functionality if operating under FIPS mode and httpd now
  starts as expected. (BZ#773473)
