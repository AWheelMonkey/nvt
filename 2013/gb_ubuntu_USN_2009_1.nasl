If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted page, an attacker
could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
invoking Firefox.(CVE-2013-1739, CVE-2013-5590, CVE-2013-5591, CVE-2013-5592)

Jordi Chancel discovered that HTML select elements could display arbitrary
content. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct
URL spoofing or clickjacking attacks (CVE-2013-5593)

Abhishek Arya discovered a crash when processing XSLT data in some
circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2013-5604)

Dan Gohman discovered a flaw in the Javascript engine. When combined
with other vulnerabilities, an attacked could possibly exploit this
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2013-5595)

Ezra Pool discovered a crash on extremely large pages. An attacked
could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-5596)

Byoungyoung Lee discovered a use-after-free when updating the offline
cache. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-5597)

Cody Crews discovered a way to append an iframe in to an embedded PDF
object displayed with PDF.js. An attacked could potentially exploit this
to read local files, leading to information disclosure. (CVE-2013-5598)

Multiple use-after-free flaws were discovered in Firefox. An attacker
could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via
application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-5599, CVE-2013-5600, CVE-2013-5601)

A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the Javascript engine when
using workers with direct proxies. An attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2013-5602)

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free when interacting with HTML
document templates. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause
a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-5603)");
