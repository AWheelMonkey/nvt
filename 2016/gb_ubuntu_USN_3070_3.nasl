Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the Reliable Datagram Sockets
(RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this
to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.
(CVE-2016-5244)

James Patrick-Evans discovered that the airspy USB device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. An attacker
with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
consumption). (CVE-2016-5400)

Yue Cao et al discovered a flaw in the TCP implementation's handling of
challenge acks in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (reset connection) or inject content into an TCP
stream. (CVE-2016-5696)

Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver in the Linux
kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
memory. (CVE-2016-5728)

Cyril Bur discovered that on PowerPC platforms, the Linux kernel mishandled
transactional memory state on exec(). A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2016-5828)

It was discovered that a heap based buffer overflow existed in the USB HID
driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this cause a denial
of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2016-5829)

It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did
not properly verify dentry state before proceeding with unlink and rename
operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2016-6197)");
