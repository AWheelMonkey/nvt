  This update for java-1_7_1-ibm fixes the following issues by updating to
  7.1-3.30 (bsc#963937):


  - CVE-2015-5041: Could could have invoked non-public interface methods
  under certain circumstances
  - CVE-2015-7575: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected
  security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function
  for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle
  techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials
  - CVE-2015-7981: libpng could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive
  information, caused by an out-of-bounds read in the
  png_convert_to_rfc1123 function. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability to obtain sensitive information
  - CVE-2015-8126: buffer overflow in libpng caused by improper bounds
  checking by the png_set_PLTE() and png_get_PLTE() functions
  - CVE-2015-8472: buffer overflow in libpng caused by improper bounds
  checking by the png_set_PLTE() and png_get_PLTE() functions
  - CVE-2015-8540: libpng is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by a
  read underflow in png_check_keyword in pngwutil.c. By sending an overly
  long argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute
  arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
  - CVE-2016-0402: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Networking
  component has no confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and
  no availability impact
  - CVE-2016-0448: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JMX component
  could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information
  - CVE-2016-0466: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JAXP
  component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service
  - CVE-2016-0483: An unspecified vulnerability related to the AWT component
  has complete confidentiality impact, complete integrity impact, and
  complete availability impact
  - CVE-2016-0494: An unspecified vulnerability related to the 2D component
  has complete confidentiality impact, complete integrity impact, and
  complete availability impact
