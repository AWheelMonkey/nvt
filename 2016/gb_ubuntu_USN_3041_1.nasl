  (CVE-2016-1705)

It was discovered that the PPAPI implementation does not validate the
origin of IPC messages to the plugin broker process. A remote attacker
could potentially exploit this to bypass sandbox protection mechanisms.
(CVE-2016-1706)

It was discovered that Blink does not prevent window creation by a
deferred frame. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass
same origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-1710)

It was discovered that Blink does not disable frame navigation during a
detach operation on a DocumentLoader object. A remote attacker could
potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.
(CVE-2016-1711)

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5127)

It was discovered that objects.cc in V8 does not prevent API interceptors
from modifying a store target without setting a property. A remote
attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin
restrictions. (CVE-2016-5128)

A memory corruption was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5129)

A security issue was discovered in Chromium. A remote attacker could
potentially exploit this to spoof the currently displayed URL.
(CVE-2016-5130)

A use-after-free was discovered in libxml. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5131)

The Service Workers implementation in Chromium does not properly implement
the Secure Contexts specification during decisions about whether to
control a subframe. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to
bypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-5132)

It was discovered that Chromium mishandles origin information during proxy
authentication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could potentially exploit this
to spoof a proxy authentication login prompt. (CVE-2016-5133)

It was discovered that the Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) feature in Chromium
