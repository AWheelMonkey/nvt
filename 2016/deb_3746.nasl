For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.3.25-6.
We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.");

    script_tag(name: "summary", value: "Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in GraphicsMagick, a collection of image processing tool, which can
cause denial of service attacks, remote file deletion, and remote command execution.

This security update removes the full support of PLT/Gnuplot decoder to
prevent Gnuplot-shell based shell exploits for fixing the
CVE-2016-3714 vulnerability.

The undocumented TMP magick prefix no longer removes the argument file
after it has been read for fixing the CVE-2016-3715 vulnerability. Since the TMP 
feature was originally implemented, GraphicsMagick added a temporary file
management subsystem which assures that temporary files are removed so this
feature is not needed.

Remove support for reading input from a shell command, or writing output
to a shell command, by prefixing the specified filename (containing the
command) for fixing the
CVE-2016-5118 vulnerability.

CVE-2015-8808 
Gustavo Grieco discovered an out of bound read in the parsing of GIF
files which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-2317 
Gustavo Grieco discovered a stack buffer overflow and two heap buffer
overflows while processing SVG images which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-2318 
Gustavo Grieco discovered several segmentation faults while processing
SVG images which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-5240 
Gustavo Grieco discovered an endless loop problem caused by negative
stroke-dasharray arguments while parsing SVG files which may cause
denial of service.

CVE-2016-7800 
Marco Grassi discovered an unsigned underflow leading to heap overflow
when parsing 8BIM chunk often attached to JPG files which may cause
denial of service.

CVE-2016-7996 
Moshe Kaplan discovered that there is no check that the provided
colormap is not larger than 256 entries in the WPG reader which may
cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-7997 
Moshe Kaplan discovered that an assertion is thrown for some files in
the WPG reader due to a logic error which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8682 
Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a stack buffer read overflow
while reading the SCT header which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8683 
Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the
PCX coder which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8684 
Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the
SGI coder which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-9830 
Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in
MagickRealloc() function which may cause denial of service.");
