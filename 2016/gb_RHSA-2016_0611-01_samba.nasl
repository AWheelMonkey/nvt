(CIFS) protocol, which allow PC-compatible machines to share files, printers, and
various information.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws were found in Samba's DCE/RPC protocol implementation. A
remote, authenticated attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service against the Samba server (high CPU load or a crash) or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running Samba
(root). This flaw could also be used to downgrade a secure DCE/RPC
connection by a man-in-the-middle attacker taking control of an Active
Directory (AD) object and compromising the security of a Samba Active
Directory Domain Controller (DC). (CVE-2015-5370)

Note: While Samba packages as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not
support running Samba as an AD DC, this flaw applies to all roles Samba
implements.

* A protocol flaw, publicly referred to as Badlock, was found in the
Security Account Manager Remote Protocol (MS-SAMR) and the Local Security
Authority (Domain Policy) Remote Protocol (MS-LSAD). Any authenticated
DCE/RPC connection that a client initiates against a server could be used
by a man-in-the-middle attacker to impersonate the authenticated user
against the SAMR or LSA service on the server. As a result, the attacker
would be able to get read/write access to the Security Account Manager
database, and use this to reveal all passwords or any other potentially
sensitive information in that database. (CVE-2016-2118)

* It was discovered that Samba configured as a Domain Controller would
establish a secure communication channel with a machine using a spoofed
computer name. A remote attacker able to observe network traffic could use
this flaw to obtain session-related information about the spoofed machine.
(CVE-2016-2111)

* It was found that Samba's LDAP implementation did not enforce integrity
protection for LDAP connections. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use
this flaw to downgrade LDAP connections to use no integrity protection,
allowing them to hijack such connections. (CVE-2016-2112)

* It was found that Samba did not enable integrity protection for IPC
traffic by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to
view and modify the data sent between a Samba server and a client.
(CVE-2016-2115)

Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting these issues.
