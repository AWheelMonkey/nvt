CVE-2016-1927 
The suggestPassword function relied on a non-secure random number
generator which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess
generated passwords via a brute-force approach.

CVE-2016-2039 
CSRF token values were generated by a non-secure random number
generator, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
restrictions by predicting a value.

CVE-2016-2040 
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-2041 
phpMyAdmin does not use a constant-time algorithm for comparing
CSRF tokens, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass
intended access restrictions by measuring time differences.

CVE-2016-2560 
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-2561 
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5099 
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5701 
For installations running on plain HTTP, phpMyAdmin allows remote
attackers to conduct BBCode injection attacks against HTTP sessions
via a crafted URI.

CVE-2016-5705 
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5706 
phpMyAdmin allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(resource consumption) via a large array in the scripts parameter.

CVE-2016-5731 
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5733 
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5739 
A specially crafted Transformation could leak information which
a remote attacker could use to perform cross site request forgeries.");
