  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the
  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols,
  as well as a full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  A padding oracle flaw was found in the Secure Sockets Layer version 2.0
  (SSLv2) protocol. An attacker can potentially use this flaw to decrypt
  RSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer SSL/TLS protocol
  version, allowing them to decrypt such connections. This cross-protocol
  attack is publicly referred to as DROWN. (CVE-2016-0800)

  Note: This issue was addressed by disabling the SSLv2 protocol by default
  when using the 'SSLv23' connection methods, and removing support for weak
  SSLv2 cipher suites. For more information, refer to the knowledge base
  article linked to in the References section.

  A flaw was found in the way malicious SSLv2 clients could negotiate SSLv2
  ciphers that have been disabled on the server. This could result in weak
  SSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections, making them vulnerable to
  man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2015-3197)

  A side-channel attack was found that makes use of cache-bank conflicts on
  the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. An attacker who has the ability
  to control code in a thread running on the same hyper-threaded core as the
  victim's thread that is performing decryption, could use this flaw to
  recover RSA private keys. (CVE-2016-0702)

  A double-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain malformed
  DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) private keys. An attacker could create
  specially crafted DSA private keys that, when processed by an application
  compiled against OpenSSL, could cause the application to crash.
  (CVE-2016-0705)

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a NULL pointer dereference or a
  heap-based memory corruption, was found in the way some BIGNUM functions of
  OpenSSL were implemented. Applications that use these functions with large
  untrusted input could crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2016-0797)
