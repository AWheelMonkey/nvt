  a parent directory . This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
  and Ubuntu 15.10. (CVE-2015-5174)

It was discovered that the Tomcat mapper component incorrectly handled
redirects. A remote attacker could use this issue to determine the
existence of a directory. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 15.10. (CVE-2015-5345)

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled different session
settings when multiple versions of the same web application was deployed. A
remote attacker could possibly use this issue to hijack web sessions. This
issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 15.10. (CVE-2015-5346)

It was discovered that the Tomcat Manager and Host Manager applications

affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 15.10.
(CVE-2016-0706)

It was discovered that the Tomcat session-persistence implementation

issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 15.10.
(CVE-2016-0714)

It was discovered that the Tomcat setGlobalContext method incorrectly
checked if callers were authorized. A remote attacker could possibly use
this issue to read or wite to arbitrary application data, or cause a denial
of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and
Ubuntu 15.10. (CVE-2016-0763)
