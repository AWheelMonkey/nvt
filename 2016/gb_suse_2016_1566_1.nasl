  These security issues introduced by the bundled openssl were fixed by
  going to version 1.0.2h:

  - CVE-2016-2107: The AES-NI implementation in OpenSSL did not consider
  memory allocation during a certain padding check, which allowed remote
  attackers to obtain sensitive cleartext information via a padding-oracle
  attack against an AES CBC session (bsc#977616).

  - CVE-2016-2105: Integer overflow in the EVP_EncodeUpdate function in
  crypto/evp/encode.c in OpenSSL allowed remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (heap memory corruption) via a large amount of binary
  data (bsc#977614).

  - CVE-2016-0705: Double free vulnerability in the dsa_priv_decode function
  in crypto/dsa/dsa_ameth.c in OpenSSL allowed remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via a malformed DSA private key (bsc#968047).

  - CVE-2016-0797: Multiple integer overflows in OpenSSL allowed remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption or NULL
  pointer dereference) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
  long digit string that is mishandled by the (1) BN_dec2bn or (2)
  BN_hex2bn function, related to crypto/bn/bn.h and crypto/bn/bn_print.c
  (bsc#968048).

  - CVE-2016-0702: The MOD_EXP_CTIME_COPY_FROM_PREBUF function in
  crypto/bn/bn_exp.c in OpenSSL did not properly consider cache-bank
  access times during modular exponentiation, which made it easier for
  local users to discover RSA keys by running a crafted application on the
  same Intel Sandy Bridge CPU core as a victim and leveraging cache-bank
  conflicts, aka a 'CacheBleed' attack (bsc#968050).

  These non-security issues were fixed:

  - Fix faulty 'if' condition (string cannot equal a boolean).

  - buffer: Buffer no longer errors if you call lastIndexOf with a search
  term longer than the buffer.

  - contextify: Context objects are now properly garbage collected, this
  solves a problem some individuals were experiencing with extreme memory
  growth.

  - Update npm to 2.15.5.

  - http: Invalid status codes can no longer be sent. Limited to 3 digit
  numbers between 100 - 999.

  - deps: Fix --gdbjit for embedders. Backported from v8 upstream.

  - querystring: Restore throw when attempting to stringify bad surrogate
  pair.

  - https: Under certain conditions SSL sockets may have been causing a
  memory leak when keepalive is enabled. This is no longer the case.

  - lib: The way that we were internally passing arguments was causing a
  potential leak. By copy ...
