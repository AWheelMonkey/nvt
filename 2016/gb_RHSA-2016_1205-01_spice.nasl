Environments (SPICE) is a remote display system built for virtual environments which
allows the user to view a computing 'desktop' environment not only on the machine
where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of
machine architectures.

Security Fix(es):

  * A memory allocation flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in spice's smartcard interaction, which runs under the QEMU-KVM
context on the host. A user connecting to a guest VM using spice could
potentially use this flaw to crash the QEMU-KVM process or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the host's QEMU-KVM process.
(CVE-2016-0749)

  * A memory access flaw was found in the way spice handled certain guests
using crafted primary surface parameters. A user in a guest could use this
flaw to read from and write to arbitrary memory locations on the host.
(CVE-2016-2150)

The CVE-2016-0749 issue was discovered by Jing Zhao (Red Hat) and the
CVE-2016-2150 issue was discovered by Frediano Ziglio (Red Hat).");
