  responding synchronously to permission requests. An attacker could potentially
  exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
  (CVE-2016-1578)

  An out-of-bounds read was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to
  opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
  this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. (CVE-2016-1646)

  A use-after-free was discovered in the navigation implementation in
  Chromium in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
  specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
  cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2016-1647)

  A buffer overflow was discovered in ANGLE. If a user were tricked in to
  opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
  this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
  (CVE-2016-1649)

  An out-of-bounds write was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to
  opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
  this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the sandboxed renderer process.
  (CVE-2016-1653)

  An invalid read was discovered in the media subsystem in Chromium. If a
  user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
  could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via
  application crash. (CVE-2016-1654)

  It was discovered that frame removal during callback execution could
  trigger a use-after-free in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening
  a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this
  to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the sandboxed renderer process.
  (CVE-2016-1655)

  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
  tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
  potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial
  of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2016-1659)

  Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked
  in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
