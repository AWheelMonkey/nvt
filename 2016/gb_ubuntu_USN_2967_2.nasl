  (CVE-2013-4312)

  Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the
  Linux kernel did not properly sanity check the endpoints reported by the
  device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service
  (system crash). (CVE-2015-7515)

  Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the
  Linux kernel did not properly sanity check the endpoints reported by the
  device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service
  (system crash). (CVE-2015-7566)

  Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel
  did not properly sanity check the interfaces and endpoints reported by the
  device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service
  (system crash). (CVE-2015-7833)

  It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-
  timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote
  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-8767)

  Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux
  kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
  service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8812)

  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for
  the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to
  cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.
  (CVE-2016-0723)

  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not keep accurate track of pipe
  buffer details when error conditions occurred, due to an incomplete fix for
  CVE-2015-1805. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
  (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative
  privileges. (CVE-2016-0774)

  Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not
  take into account the mmap_min_addr value. A local attacker could use this
  to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting
  to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. (CVE-2016-0821)

  Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's
  translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local
  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak
  sensitive information. (CVE-2016-2069)

  framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a c ...
