  handled the OCSP Status Request extension. A remote attacker could possibly use
  this issue to cause memory consumption, resulting in a denial of service.
  (CVE-2016-6304)

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when
performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this
issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This
issue has only been addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in this update.
(CVE-2016-2177)

C&#233 sar Pereida, Billy Brumley, and Yuval Yarom discovered that OpenSSL
did not properly use constant-time operations when performing DSA signing.
A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a cache-timing
attack and recover private DSA keys. (CVE-2016-2178)

Quan Luo discovered that OpenSSL did not properly restrict the lifetime
of queue entries in the DTLS implementation. A remote attacker could
possibly use this issue to consume memory, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2016-2179)

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the
TS_OBJ_print_bio() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this
issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2180)

It was discovered that the OpenSSL incorrectly handled the DTLS anti-replay
feature. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2016-2181)

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly validated division results. A
remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2016-2182)

Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES
ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks. A remote attacker could
possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted
sessions. This update moves DES from the HIGH cipher list to MEDIUM.
(CVE-2016-2183)

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain ticket lengths.
A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2016-6302)

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the
MDC2_Update() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6303)

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed certain message
length checks. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2016-6306)");
