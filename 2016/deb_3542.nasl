* O(1) delta-compressed file storage and retrieval scheme
* Complete cross-indexing of files and changesets for efficient exploration
of project history
* Robust SHA1-based integrity checking and append-only storage model
* Decentralized development model with arbitrary merging between trees
* High-speed HTTP-based network merge protocol
* Easy-to-use command-line interface
* Integrated stand-alone web interface
* Small Python codebase");

CVE-2016-3068

clone.

CVE-2016-3069 
Blake Burkhart discovered that Mercurial allows arbitrary code
execution when converting Git repositories with specially
crafted names.

CVE-2016-3630 
It was discovered that Mercurial does not properly perform bounds-checking
in its binary delta decoder, which may be exploitable for
remote code execution via clone, push or pull.");
