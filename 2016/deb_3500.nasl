toolkit.

CVE-2016-0702 
Yuval Yarom from the University of Adelaide and NICTA, Daniel Genkin
from Technion and Tel Aviv University, and Nadia Heninger from the
University of Pennsylvania discovered a side-channel attack which
makes use of cache-bank conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge
microarchitecture. This could allow local attackers to recover RSA
private keys.

CVE-2016-0705 
Adam Langley from Google discovered a double free bug when parsing
malformed DSA private keys. This could allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service or memory corruption in applications
parsing DSA private keys received from untrusted sources.

CVE-2016-0797 
Guido Vranken discovered an integer overflow in the BN_hex2bn and
BN_dec2bn functions that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and
heap corruption. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial
of service or memory corruption in applications processing hex or
dec data received from untrusted sources.

CVE-2016-0798 
Emilia Kasper of the OpenSSL development team discovered a memory
leak in the SRP database lookup code. To mitigate the memory leak,
the seed handling in SRP_VBASE_get_by_user is now disabled even if
the user has configured a seed. Applications are advised to migrate
to the SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user function.

CVE-2016-0799 
Guido Vranken discovered an integer overflow in the BIO_*printf
functions that could lead to an OOB read when printing very long
strings. Additionally the internal doapr_outch function can attempt
to write to an arbitrary memory location in the event of a memory
allocation failure. These issues will only occur on platforms where
sizeof(size_t)> sizeof(int) like many 64 bit systems. This could
allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or memory
corruption in applications that pass large amounts of untrusted data
to the BIO_*printf functions.

Additionally the EXPORT and LOW ciphers were disabled since thay could
be used as part of the DROWN
(CVE-2016-0800)
and SLOTH
(CVE-2015-7575 
)
attacks, but note that the oldstable (wheezy) and stable (jessie)
distributions are not affected by those attacks since the SSLv2 protocol
has already been dropped in the openssl package version 1.0.0c-2.");
