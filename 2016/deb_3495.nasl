applications-monitoring system, was vulnerable to the following
security issues:

CVE-2016-2054The incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the config 

command can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in
denial of service (via application crash) or remote code execution.

CVE-2016-2055The incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the config 

command can lead to an information leak by serving sensitive
configuration files to a remote user.

CVE-2016-2056 
The commands handling password management do not properly validate
user-supplied input, and are thus vulnerable to shell command
injection by a remote user.

CVE-2016-2057 
Incorrect permissions on an internal queuing system allow a user
with a local account on the xymon master server to bypass all
network-based access control lists, and thus inject messages
directly into xymon.

CVE-2016-2058 
Incorrect escaping of user-supplied input in status webpages can
be used to trigger reflected cross-site scripting attacks.");
