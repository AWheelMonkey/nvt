  incorrectly handled authenticated broadcast mode. A remote attacker could use
  this issue to perform a replay attack. (CVE-2015-7973)

Matt Street discovered that NTP incorrectly verified peer associations of
symmetric keys. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform an
impersonation attack. (CVE-2015-7974)

Jonathan Gardner discovered that the NTP ntpq utility incorrectly handled
memory. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ntpq to crash,
resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04
LTS. (CVE-2015-7975)

Jonathan Gardner discovered that the NTP ntpq utility incorrectly handled
dangerous characters in filenames. An attacker could possibly use this
issue to overwrite arbitrary files. (CVE-2015-7976)

Stephen Gray discovered that NTP incorrectly handled large restrict lists.
An attacker could use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a
denial of service. (CVE-2015-7977, CVE-2015-7978)

Aanchal Malhotra discovered that NTP incorrectly handled authenticated
broadcast mode. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause NTP to
crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-7979)

Jonathan Gardner discovered that NTP incorrectly handled origin timestamp
checks. A remote attacker could use this issue to spoof peer servers.
(CVE-2015-8138)

Jonathan Gardner discovered that the NTP ntpq utility did not properly

to cause ntpq to hang, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-8158)

It was discovered that the NTP cronjob incorrectly cleaned up the
statistics directory. A local attacker could possibly use this to escalate
privileges. (CVE-2016-0727)

Stephen Gray and Matthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly
validated crypto-NAKs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
prevent clients from synchronizing. (CVE-2016-1547)

handled switching to interleaved symmetric mode. A remote attacker could
possibly use this issue to prevent clients from synchronizing.
(CVE-2016-1548)

Matthew Van Gundy, Stephen Gray and Loganaden Velvindron discovered that
NTP incorrectly handled message authentication. A remote attacker could
possibly use this issue to recover the message digest key. (CVE-2016-1550)

Yihan Lian discovered that NTP incorrectly handled duplicate IPs on
