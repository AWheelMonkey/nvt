  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Symantec Encryption Management Server's web administration interface was susceptible to command execution on the underlying operating system when an authorized but less-privileged administrator has console access. Input fields available through the server console did not properly filter arbitrary user input which could allow OS command execution with elevated privileges.

By leveraging the successful exploitation above, an unauthorized user could have scheduled arbitrary commands to run through existing batch files on the underlying operating system that normally run with root privileges. This could have resulted in additional privileged access to the server.

The LDAP service provided by Symantec Encryption Management Server was susceptible to heap memory corruption. Specially-crafted request packets could result in corrupted memory block headers leading to a SIGSEGV fault and service halt.

By successfully manipulating an LDAP request, it was possible for a user able to access the LDAP server to gather information on valid administrator accounts on the server. This information could potentially be used for further attempts to gain unauthorized access to the server or network. ");
