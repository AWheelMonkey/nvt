  ContainerNode::parserRemoveChild function in Blink mishandled widget updates
  in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
  crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass
  same-origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-1630)

  It was discovered that the PPB_Flash_MessageLoop_Impl::InternalRun
  function in Chromium mishandled nested message loops. If a user were
  tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
  potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.
  (CVE-2016-1631)

  Multiple use-after-frees were discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked
  in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
  exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.
  (CVE-2016-1633, CVE-2016-1634, CVE-2016-1644)

  It was discovered that the PendingScript::notifyFinished function in
  Blink relied on memory-cache information about integrity-check occurrences
  instead of integrity-check successes. If a user were tricked in to opening
  a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
  bypass Subresource Integrity (SRI) protections. (CVE-2016-1636)

  It was discovered that the SkATan2_255 function in Skia mishandled
  arctangent calculations. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
  crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain
  sensitive information. (CVE-2016-1637)

  A use-after-free was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to
  opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
  this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
  (CVE-2016-1641)

  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
  tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
  potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial
  of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2016-1642)

  A type-confusion bug was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in
  to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
  exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.
  (CVE-2016-1643)

  Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked
