  - The XML/JSON API endpoints providing information about installed plugins
    were missing permissions checks, allowing any user with read access to
    Jenkins to determine which plugins and versions were installed.

  - The users with extended read access could access encrypted secrets stored
    directly in the configuration of those items.

  - A missing permissions check allowed any user with access to Jenkins to trigger
    an update of update site metadata. This could be combined with DNS cache
    poisoning to disrupt Jenkins service.

  - The Some Jenkins URLs did not properly validate the redirect URLs, which
    allowed malicious users to create URLs that redirect users to arbitrary
    scheme-relative URLs.

  - The API URL /computer/(master)/api/xml allowed users with the 'extended read'
    permission for the master node to see some global Jenkins configuration,
    including the configuration of the security realm.

  - By changing the freely editable 'full name', malicious users with multiple
    user accounts could prevent other users from logging in, as 'full name' was
    resolved before actual user name to determine which account is currently trying
    to log in.

  - An improper validation of build parameters in Jenkins.");
