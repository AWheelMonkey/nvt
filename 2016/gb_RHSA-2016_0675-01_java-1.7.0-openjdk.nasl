Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws were discovered in the Serialization and Hotspot
components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use
these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-0686,
CVE-2016-0687)

* It was discovered that the RMI server implementation in the JMX component
in OpenJDK did not restrict which classes can be deserialized when
deserializing authentication credentials. A remote, unauthenticated
attacker able to connect to a JMX port could possibly use this flaw to
trigger deserialization flaws. (CVE-2016-3427)

* It was discovered that the JAXP component in OpenJDK failed to properly
handle Unicode surrogate pairs used as part of the XML attribute values.
Specially crafted XML input could cause a Java application to use an
excessive amount of memory when parsed. (CVE-2016-3425)

* It was discovered that the Security component in OpenJDK failed to check
the digest algorithm strength when generating DSA signatures. The use of a
digest weaker than the key strength could lead to the generation of
signatures that were weaker than expected. (CVE-2016-0695)

Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the icedtea-web package was
installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited
without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website.
