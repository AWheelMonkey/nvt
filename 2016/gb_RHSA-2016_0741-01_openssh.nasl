  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"OpenSSH is an SSH protocol implementation supported by a number of Linux,
UNIX, and similar operating systems. It includes the core files necessary
for both the OpenSSH client and server.

Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that the OpenSSH client did not properly enforce the
ForwardX11Timeout setting. A malicious or compromised remote X application
could possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local
X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested.
(CVE-2015-5352)

  * A flaw was found in the way OpenSSH handled PAM authentication when using
privilege separation. An attacker with valid credentials on the system and
able to fully compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using
a different flaw could use this flaw to authenticate as other users.
(CVE-2015-6563)

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in OpenSSH. An attacker able to fully
compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using a different
flaw could possibly cause sshd to crash or execute arbitrary code with root
privileges. (CVE-2015-6564)

  * An access flaw was discovered in OpenSSH  the OpenSSH client did not
correctly handle failures to generate authentication cookies for untrusted
X11 forwarding. A malicious or compromised remote X application could
possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X
server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested.
(CVE-2016-1908)
