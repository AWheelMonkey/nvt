  script_tag(name:"summary", value:"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security
Firewall devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain
administrative privileges on a targeted device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of HTTP request headers that are sent to
the web-based management interface of an affected device. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains malicious SQL statements
to the management interface of a targeted device. Depending on whether remote management is
configured for the device, the management interface may use the SQL code in the HTTP request header
to determine user privileges for the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass
authentication on the management interface and gain administrative privileges on the device.

Cisco released a firmware update that addresses this vulnerability. There are workarounds that
address this vulnerability.
