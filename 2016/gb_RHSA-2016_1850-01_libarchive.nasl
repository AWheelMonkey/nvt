  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The libarchive programming library can create
  and read several different streaming archive formats, including GNU tar, cpio and
  ISO 9660 CD-ROM images. Libarchive is used notably in the bsdtar utility, scripting
  language bindings such as python-libarchive, and several popular desktop
  file managers.

Security Fix(es):

  * A flaw was found in the way libarchive handled hardlink archive entries
of non-zero size. Combined with flaws in libarchive's file system
sandboxing, this issue could cause an application using libarchive to
overwrite arbitrary files with arbitrary data from the archive.
(CVE-2016-5418)

  * Multiple out-of-bounds read flaws were found in libarchive. Specially
crafted AR or MTREE files could cause the application to read data out of
bounds, potentially disclosing a small amount of application memory, or
causing an application crash. (CVE-2015-8920, CVE-2015-8921)

  * A denial of service vulnerability was found in libarchive's handling of
GZIP streams. A crafted GZIP file could cause libarchive to allocate an
excessive amount of memory, eventually leading to a crash. (CVE-2016-7166)

  * A denial of service vulnerability was found in libarchive. A specially
crafted CPIO archive containing a symbolic link to a large target path
could cause memory allocation to fail, causing an application using
libarchive that attempted to view or extract such archive to crash.
(CVE-2016-4809)

  * Multiple instances of undefined behavior due to arithmetic overflow were
found in libarchive. Specially crafted Compress streams or ISO9660 volumes
could potentially cause the application to fail to read the archive, or to
crash. (CVE-2015-8932, CVE-2016-5844)

Red Hat would like to thank Insomnia Security for reporting CVE-2016-5418.");
