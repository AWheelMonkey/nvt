A use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5171)

An issue was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
ontain sensitive information from arbitrary memory locations.
(CVE-2016-5172)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial
of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2016-5175, CVE-2016-5178)

A use-after-free was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5177)

It was discovered that Chromium does not ensure the recipient of a certain
IPC message is a valid RenderFrame or RenderWidget. An attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-7549)");
