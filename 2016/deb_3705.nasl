    script_tag(name: "summary",   value: "Several vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library:

CVE-2016-8615 
It was discovered that a malicious HTTP server could inject new
cookies for arbitrary domains into a cookie jar.

CVE-2016-8616 
It was discovered that when re-using a connection, curl was doing case
insensitive comparisons of user name and password with the existing
connections.

CVE-2016-8617 
It was discovered that on systems with 32-bit addresses in userspace
(e.g. x86, ARM, x32), the output buffer size value calculated in the
base64 encode function would wrap around if input size was at least
1GB of data, causing an undersized output buffer to be allocated.

CVE-2016-8618 
It was discovered that the curl_maprintf() function could be tricked
into doing a double-free due to an unsafe size_t multiplication on
systems using 32 bit size_t variables.

CVE-2016-8619 
It was discovered that the Kerberos implementation could be
tricked into doing a double-free when reading one of the length fields
from a socket.

CVE-2016-8620It was discovered that the curl tool's globbing 
feature could write
to invalid memory areas when parsing invalid ranges.

CVE-2016-8621 
It was discovered that the function curl_getdate could read out of
bounds when parsing invalid date strings.

CVE-2016-8622 
It was discovered that the URL percent-encoding decode function would
return a signed 32bit integer variable as length, even though it
allocated a destination buffer larger than 2GB, which would lead to
a out-of-bounds write.

CVE-2016-8623 
It was discovered that libcurl could access an already-freed memory
area due to concurrent access to shared cookies. This could lead to
a denial of service or disclosure of sensitive information.

CVE-2016-8624 
It was discovered that curl wouldn't parse the authority component of
a URL correctly when the host name part ends with a '#' character,
and could be tricked into connecting to a different host.");
