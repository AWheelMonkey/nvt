The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version:
squid (3.5.20). (BZ#1273942, BZ#1349775)

Security Fix(es):

* Incorrect boundary checks were found in the way squid handled headers in
HTTP responses, which could lead to an assertion failure. A malicious HTTP
server could use this flaw to crash squid using a specially crafted HTTP
response. (CVE-2016-2569, CVE-2016-2570)

* It was found that squid did not properly handle errors when failing to
parse an HTTP response, possibly leading to an assertion failure. A
malicious HTTP server could use this flaw to crash squid using a specially
crafted HTTP response. (CVE-2016-2571, CVE-2016-2572)

* An incorrect boundary check was found in the way squid handled the Vary
header in HTTP responses, which could lead to an assertion failure. A
malicious HTTP server could use this flaw to crash squid using a specially
crafted HTTP response. (CVE-2016-3948)
