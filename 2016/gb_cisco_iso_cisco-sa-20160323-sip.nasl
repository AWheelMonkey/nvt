The vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed SIP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SIP messages to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak and eventual reload of the affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability other than disabling SIP on the vulnerable device.
