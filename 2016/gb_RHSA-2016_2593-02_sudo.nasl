which allows system administrators to provide certain users with the permission
to execute privileged commands, which are used for system management purposes,
without having to log in as root.

Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that the default sudo configuration preserved the value
of INPUTRC from the user's environment, which could lead to information
disclosure. A local user with sudo access to a restricted program that uses
readline could use this flaw to read content from specially formatted files
with elevated privileges provided by sudo. (CVE-2016-7091)

Note: With this update, INPUTRC was removed from the env_keep list in
/etc/sudoers to avoid having sudo preserve the value of this variable when
invoking privileged commands.

Red Hat would like to thank Grisha Levit for reporting this issue.
