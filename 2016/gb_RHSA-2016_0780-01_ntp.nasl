Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three issues
were found in the value length checks in NTP's ntp_crypto.c, where a packet
with particular autokey operations that contained malicious data was not
always being completely validated. A remote attacker could use a specially
crafted NTP packet to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692,
CVE-2015-7702)

  * A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO_ASSOC. If ntpd was
configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send packets to
ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack, cause it to run out
of memory. (CVE-2015-7701)

  * An off-by-one flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in
cookedprint functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted NTP packet could
potentially cause ntpq to crash. (CVE-2015-7852)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way ntpd processed
'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount
of entries. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash
ntpd. (CVE-2015-7977)

  * A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way ntpd processed
'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount
of entries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash ntpd.
(CVE-2015-7978)

  * It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized variable when
processing malformed logconfig configuration commands. (CVE-2015-5194)

  * It was found that ntpd would exit with a segmentation fault when a
statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g. timingstats)
was referenced by the statistics or filegen configuration command.
(CVE-2015-5195)

  * It was discovered that the sntp utility could become unresponsive due to
being caught in an infinite loop when processing a crafted NTP packet.
(CVE-2015-5219)

  * It was found that NTP's :config command could be used to set the pidfile
and driftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing the
pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the
system clock (in hourly intervals). (CVE-2015-7703)
