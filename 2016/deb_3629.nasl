in the Network Time Protocol daemon and utility programs:

CVE-2015-7974 
Matt Street discovered that insufficient key validation allows
impersonation attacks between authenticated peers.

CVE-2015-7977CVE-2015-7978Stephen Gray discovered that a NULL pointer dereference
and a buffer overflow in the handling of ntpdc reslist 
commands may
result in denial of service.

CVE-2015-7979 
Aanchal Malhotra discovered that if NTP is configured for broadcast
mode, an attacker can send malformed authentication packets which
break associations with the server for other broadcast clients.

CVE-2015-8138 
Matthew van Gundy and Jonathan Gardner discovered that missing
validation of origin timestamps in ntpd clients may result in denial
of service.

CVE-2015-8158 
Jonathan Gardner discovered that missing input sanitising in ntpq
may result in denial of service.

CVE-2016-1547 
Stephen Gray and Matthew van Gundy discovered that incorrect handling
of crypto NAK packets may result in denial of service.

CVE-2016-1548 
Jonathan Gardner and Miroslav Lichvar discovered that ntpd clients
could be forced to change from basic client/server mode to interleaved
symmetric mode, preventing time synchronisation.

CVE-2016-1550 
Matthew van Gundy, Stephen Gray and Loganaden Velvindron discovered
that timing leaks in the the packet authentication code could result
in recovery of a message digest.

CVE-2016-2516Yihan Lian discovered that duplicate IPs on unconfig 
directives will
trigger an assert.

CVE-2016-2518 
Yihan Lian discovered that an OOB memory access could potentially
crash ntpd.");
