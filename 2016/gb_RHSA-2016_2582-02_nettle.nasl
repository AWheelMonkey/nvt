  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Nettle is a cryptographic library that is
designed to fit easily in almost any context: In cryptographic toolkits for
object-oriented languages, such as C++, Python, or Pike, in applications like lsh
or GnuPG, or even in kernel space.

Security Fix(es):

  * Multiple flaws were found in the way nettle implemented elliptic curve
scalar multiplication. These flaws could potentially introduce
cryptographic weaknesses into nettle's functionality. (CVE-2015-8803,
CVE-2015-8804, CVE-2015-8805)

  * It was found that nettle's RSA and DSA decryption code was vulnerable to
cache-related side channel attacks. An attacker could use this flaw to
recover the private key from a co-located virtual-machine instance.
(CVE-2016-6489)
