generation within affected appliances.

This is an attack on the client attempting to access the device and does not compromise the device itself.
To exploit the issue, an attacker needs not only the public and private key pair but also a privileged position
in the network that would allow him or her to  monitor the traffic between client and server, intercept the
traffic, and modify or inject its own traffic.");
