  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"ntpd contains multiple vulnerabilities:

  - When ntpd receives a server response on a socket that corresponds to a different interface than was used for
the request, the peer structure is updated to use the interface for new requests. If ntpd is running on a host
with multiple interfaces in separate networks and the operating system doesn't check source address in received
packets (e.g. rp_filter on Linux is set to 0), an attacker that knows the address of the source can send a
packet with spoofed source address which will cause ntpd to select wrong interface for the source and prevent
it from sending new requests until the list of interfaces is refreshed, which happens on routing changes or
every 5 minutes by default. If the attack is repeated often enough (once per second), ntpd will not be able to
synchronize with the source. (CVE-2016-7429)

  - Bug 2085 described a condition where the root delay was included twice, causing the jitter value to be higher
than expected. Due to a misinterpretation of a small-print variable in The Book, the fix for this problem was
incorrect, resulting in a root distance that did not include the peer dispersion. The calculations and formulae
have been reviewed and reconciled, and the code has been updated accordingly. (CVE-2016-7433)");
