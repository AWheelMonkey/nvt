A use-after-free was discovered in the WebCrypto implementation in Blink.
If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an
attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5142)

It was discovered that the devtools subsystem in Blink mishandles various
parameters. An attacker could exploit this to bypass intended access
restrictions. (CVE-2016-5143, CVE-2016-5144)

It was discovered that Blink does not ensure that a taint property is
preserved after a structure-clone operation on an ImageBitmap object
derived from a cross-origin image. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
bypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-5145)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial
of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2016-5146, CVE-2016-5167)

It was discovered that Blink mishandles deferred page loads. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
(CVE-2016-5147)

An issue was discovered in Blink related to widget updates. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
(CVE-2016-5148)

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5150)

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5153)

It was discovered that Chromium does not correctly validate access to the
initial document. An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the
currently displayed URL. (CVE-2016-5155)
