kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use

(CVE-2016-2117)

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()
handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a
recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-1583)

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB
over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially
sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-4004)

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB
device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker
with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2016-2187)

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would
improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86
processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were
disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an
existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. (CVE-2016-3672)

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver
in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error
occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3951)

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling
incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-3955)

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress
hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest
OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). (CVE-2016-3961)

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2
Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use
this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.
(CVE-2016-4485)

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket
interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker
