  read during XML parsing in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to
  opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this
  to cause a denial of service via application crash, or obtain sensitive
  information. (CVE-2016-0718)

Toni Huttunen discovered that once a favicon is requested from a site,
the remote server can keep the network connection open even after the page
is closed. A remote attacked could potentially exploit this to track
users, resulting in information disclosure. (CVE-2016-2830)

Christian Holler, Tyson Smith, Boris Zbarsky, Byron Campen, Julian Seward,
Carsten Book, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew McCreight, and Phil
Ringnalda discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2835, CVE-2016-2836)

A buffer overflow was discovered in the ClearKey Content Decryption
Module (CDM) during video playback. If a user were tricked in to opening
a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
cause a denial of service via plugin process crash, or, in combination
with another vulnerability to escape the GMP sandbox, execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2016-2837)

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow when rendering SVG content in
some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2016-2838)

Bert Massop discovered a crash in Cairo with version 0.10 of FFmpeg. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2839)

Catalin Dumitru discovered that URLs of resources loaded after a
navigation start could be leaked to the following page via the Resource
Timing API. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive
information. (CVE-2016-5250)

Firas Salem discovered an issue with non-ASCII and emoji characters in
data: URLs. An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the
addressbar contents. (CVE-2016-5251)

Georg Koppen discovered a stack buffer underflow during 2D graphics
rendering in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
