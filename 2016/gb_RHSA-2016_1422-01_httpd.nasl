Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that httpd used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP
requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts,
which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations
to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could
possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script
to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.
(CVE-2016-5387)

Note: After this update, httpd will no longer pass the value of the Proxy
request header to scripts via the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.

Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

  * In a caching proxy configuration, the mod_cache module would treat
content as stale if the Expires header changed when refreshing a cached
response. As a consequence, an origin server returning content without a
fixed Expires header would not be treated as cacheable. The mod_cache
module has been fixed to ignore changes in the Expires header when
refreshing content. As a result, such content is now cacheable, improving
performance and reducing load at the origin server. (BZ#1347648)

  * The HTTP status code 451 'Unavailable For Legal Reasons' was not usable
in the httpd configuration. As a consequence, modules such as mod_rewrite
could not be configured to return a 451 error if required for legal
purposes. The 451 status code has been added to the list of available error
codes, and modules can now be configured to return a 451 error if required.
