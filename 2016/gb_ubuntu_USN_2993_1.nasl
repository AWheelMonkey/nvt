discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2815, CVE-2016-2818)

A buffer overflow was discovered when parsing HTML5 fragments in some
circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2819)

A use-after-free was discovered in contenteditable mode in some
circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2821)

Jordi Chancel discovered a way to use a persistent menu within a  select
element and place this in an arbitrary location. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to spoof the addressbar contents. (CVE-2016-2822)

Armin Razmdjou that the location.host property can be set to an arbitrary
string after creating an invalid data: URI. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to bypass some same-origin protections. (CVE-2016-2825)

A use-after-free was discovered when processing WebGL content in some
circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2828)

Tim McCormack discovered that the permissions notification can show the
wrong icon when a page requests several permissions in quick succession.
An attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking the user in to
giving consent for access to the wrong resource. (CVE-2016-2829)

It was discovered that a pointerlock can be created in a fullscreen
window without user consent in some circumstances, and this pointerlock
cannot be cancelled without quitting Firefox. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service or conduct clickjacking attacks.
