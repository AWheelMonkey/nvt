Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed certain
configuration files read by the Tomcat initialization script as writeable
to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application
deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.
(CVE-2016-6325)

  * It was found that several Tomcat session persistence mechanisms could
allow a remote, authenticated user to bypass intended SecurityManager
restrictions and execute arbitrary code in a privileged context via a web
application that placed a crafted object in a session. (CVE-2016-0714)

  * It was discovered that tomcat used the value of the Proxy header from
HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI
scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client
implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote
attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed
by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP
request. (CVE-2016-5388)

  * A directory traversal flaw was found in Tomcat's RequestUtil.java. A
remote, authenticated user could use this flaw to bypass intended
SecurityManager restrictions and list a parent directory via a '/..' in a
pathname used by a web application in a getResource, getResourceAsStream,
or getResourcePaths call, as demonstrated by the $CATALINA_BASE/webapps
directory. (CVE-2015-5174)

  * It was found that Tomcat could reveal the presence of a directory even
when that directory was protected by a security constraint. A user could
make a request to a directory via a URL not ending with a slash and,
depending on whether Tomcat redirected that request, could confirm whether
that directory existed. (CVE-2015-5345)

  * It was found that Tomcat allowed the StatusManagerServlet to be loaded by
a web application when a security manager was configured. This allowed a
web application to list all deployed web applications and expose sensitive
information such as session IDs. (CVE-2016-0706)

Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting
CVE-2016-5388. The CVE-2016-6325 issue was discovered by Red Hat Product
Security.

Bug Fix(es):

  * Due to a bug in the tomcat6 spec file, the catalina.out file's md5sum,
size, and mtime attributes were compared to the file's attributes at
installation time. Because these attributes change after the service i ...
