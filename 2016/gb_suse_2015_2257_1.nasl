  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for mbedtls fixes the following security and non-security
  issues:

  - Update to 1.3.15

  * Fix potential double free if ssl_set_psk() is called more than once
  and some allocation fails. Cannot be forced remotely. Found by Guido
  Vranken, Intelworks.

  * Fix potential heap corruption on windows when x509_crt_parse_path() is
  passed a path longer than 2GB. Cannot be triggered remotely. Found by
  Guido Vranken, Intelworks.

  * Fix potential buffer overflow in some asn1_write_xxx() functions.
  Cannot be triggered remotely unless you create X.509 certificates based
  on untrusted input or write keys of untrusted origin. Found by Guido
  Vranken, Intelworks.

  * The x509 max_pathlen constraint was not enforced on intermediate
  certificates. Found by Nicholas Wilson, fix and tests provided by
  Janos Follath. #280 and #319

  * Self-signed certificates were not excluded from pathlen counting,
  resulting in some valid X.509 being incorrectly rejected. Found and
  fix provided by Janos Follath. #319

  * Fix bug causing some handshakes to fail due to some non-fatal alerts
  not begin properly ignored. Found by mancha and Kasom Koht-arsa, #308

  * Fix build error with configurations where ecdhe-psk is the only key
  exchange. Found and fix provided by Chris Hammond. #270

  * Fix failures in mpi on sparc(64) due to use of bad assembly code.
  Found by Kurt Danielson. #292

  * Fix typo in name of the extkeyusage oid. found by inestlerode, #314

  * Fix bug in asn.1 encoding of booleans that caused generated ca
  certificates to be rejected by some applications, including OS X
  Keychain. Found and fixed by Jonathan Leroy, Inikup.

  * Fix 'destination buffer is too small' error in cert_write program.
  Found and fixed by Jonathan Leroy, Inikup.

  - Update to 1.3.14

  * Added fix for CVE-2015-5291 (boo#949380) to prevent heap corruption
  due to buffer
  overflow of the hostname or session ticket. Found by Guido Vranken,
  Intelworks.

  * Fix stack buffer overflow in pkcs12 decryption (used by
  mbedtls_pk_parse_key(file)() when the password is   129 bytes. Found
  by Guido Vranken, Intelworks. Not triggerable remotely.

  * Fix potential buffer overflow in mbedtls_mpi_read_string(). Found by
  Guido Vranken, Intelworks. Not exploitable remotely in the context
  of TLS, but might be in other uses. On 32 bit machines, requires
  reading a string of close to or larger than 1GB to exploit  on 64 bit
  machines, would require reading a string of close to or larger than
  2^62 bytes.

  * Fix potential random memory allocation in mbedtls_pem_read_buffer()
  on crafted PEM input data. ...
