  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Goldwyn Rodrigues discovered that the OCFS2 filesystem did not correctly
  clear memory when writing certain file holes. A local attacker could
  exploit this to read uninitialized data from the disk, leading to a loss of
  privacy. (CVE-2011-0463)

  Timo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did not
  correctly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted disk
  device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.
  (CVE-2011-1017)

  It was discovered that the /proc filesystem did not correctly handle
  permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open
  files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges,
  potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional
  vulnerabilities. (CVE-2011-1020)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Bluetooth stack did not correctly clear
  memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory,
  leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-1078)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Bluetooth stack did not correctly check
  that device name strings were NULL terminated. A local attacker could
  exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or leak
  contents of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
  (CVE-2011-1079)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that bridge network filtering did not check that
  name fields were NULL terminated. A local attacker could exploit this to
  leak contents of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
  (CVE-2011-1080)

  Peter Huewe discovered that the TPM device did not correctly initialize
  memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel heap memory
  contents, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-1160)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the netfilter code did not check certain
  strings copied from userspace. A local attacker with netfilter access could
  exploit this to read kernel memory or crash the system, leading to a denial
  of service. (CVE-2011-1170, CVE-2011-1171, CVE-2011-1172, CVE-2011-2534)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Acorn Universal Networking driver did
  not correctly initialize memory. A remote attacker could send specially
  crafted traffic to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
  (CVE-2011-1173)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IRDA subsystem did not correctly check
  certain field sizes. If a system was using IRDA, a remote attacker could
  send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root privileges.
