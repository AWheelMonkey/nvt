cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly
sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit the local file-include vulnerability using
directory-traversal strings to view and execute local files within
the context of the webserver process. Information harvested may aid
in further attacks.

The attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issue to execute
arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the
context of the affected site. This may let the attacker steal cookie-
based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Podcast Generator 1.3 is vulnerable. Prior versions may also be
affected.");
