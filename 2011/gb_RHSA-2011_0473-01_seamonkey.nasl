  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could possibly lead to arbitrary code
  execution with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey.
  (CVE-2011-0080)

  An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled
  out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a
  malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution
  with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0078)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the HTML
  frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for
  the &quot;rows&quot; and &quot;cols&quot; attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading
  to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0077)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the HTML iframe tag. A web
  page with an iframe tag containing a specially-crafted source address could
  trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0075)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displayed multiple marquee elements.
  A malformed HTML document could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0074)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the nsTreeSelection element.
  Malformed content could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0073)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey appended frame and
  iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
  Malicious HTML content could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0072)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.");
