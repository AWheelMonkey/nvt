tag_insight = "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  These updated packages fix the following security issues:
  
  * a flaw was found in the IPv4 forwarding base. This could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-2172,
  Important)
  
  * a flaw was found in the handling of process death signals. This allowed a
  local, unprivileged user to send arbitrary signals to the suid-process
  executed by that user. Successful exploitation of this flaw depends on the
  structure of the suid-program and its signal handling. (CVE-2007-3848,
  Important)
  
  * when accessing kernel memory locations, certain Linux kernel drivers
  registering a fault handler did not perform required range checks. A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to gain read or write access to
  arbitrary kernel memory, or possibly cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2008-0007, Important)
  
  * a possible kernel memory leak was found in the Linux kernel Simple
  Internet Transition (SIT) INET6 implementation. This could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2008-2136, Important)
  
  * missing capability checks were found in the SBNI WAN driver which could
  allow a local, unprivileged user to bypass intended capability
  restrictions. (CVE-2008-3525, Important)
  
  * a flaw was found in the way files were written using truncate() or
  ftruncate(). This could allow a local, unprivileged user to acquire the
  privileges of a different group and obtain access to sensitive information.
  (CVE-2008-4210, Important)
  
  * a race condition in the mincore system core allowed a local, unprivileged
  user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2006-4814, Moderate)
  
  * a flaw was found in the aacraid SCSI driver. This allowed a local,
  unprivileged user to make ioctl calls to the driver which should otherwise
  be restricted to privileged users. (CVE-2007-4308, Moderate)
  
  * two buffer overflow flaws were found in the Integrated Services Digital
  Network (ISDN) subsystem. A local, unprivileged user could use these flaws
  to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-6063, CVE-2007-6151, Moderate)
  
  * a flaw was found in the way core dump files were created. If a local,
  unprivileged user could make a root-owned process dump a core file into a
  user-writable directory, the user could gain read access to that core file,
  potentially compromising sensitive information. (CVE-2007-6206, Moderate)
  
  * a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel virtual file system (VFS)
  implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged ...
