  A flaw was found in the Python urllib and urllib2 libraries where they
  would not differentiate between different target URLs when handling
  automatic redirects. This caused Python applications using these modules to
  follow any new URL that they understood, including the &quot;file://&quot; URL type.
  This could allow a remote server to force a local Python application to
  read a local file instead of the remote one, possibly exposing local files
  that were not meant to be exposed. (CVE-2011-1521)

  Multiple flaws were found in the Python audioop module. Supplying certain
  inputs could cause the audioop module to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-1634, CVE-2010-2089)

  A race condition was found in the way the Python smtpd module handled new
  connections. A remote user could use this flaw to cause a Python script
  using the smtpd module to terminate. (CVE-2010-3493)

  An information disclosure flaw was found in the way the Python
  CGIHTTPServer module processed certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker
  could use a specially-crafted request to obtain the CGI script's source
  code. (CVE-2011-1015)

  A buffer over-read flaw was found in the way the Python Expat parser
  handled malformed UTF-8 sequences when processing XML files. A
  specially-crafted XML file could cause Python applications using the Python
  Expat parser to crash while parsing the file. (CVE-2009-3720)

  This update makes Python use the system Expat library rather than its own
  internal copy; therefore, users must have the version of Expat shipped with
  RHSA-2009:1625 installed, or a later version, to resolve the CVE-2009-3720
  issue.

  All Python users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.");
