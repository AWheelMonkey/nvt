  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed JPEG images. A
  website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2011-2377)

  Multiple dangling pointer flaws were found in Firefox. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2011-0083, CVE-2011-0085, CVE-2011-2363)

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2011-2364, CVE-2011-2365, CVE-2011-2374, CVE-2011-2375,
  CVE-2011-2376)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled JavaScript
  Array objects. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause
  Firefox to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2011-2371)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed
  JavaScript. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause Firefox
  to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2011-2373)

  It was found that Firefox could treat two separate cookies as
  interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one of those
  domain names had a trailing &quot;.&quot; character. This violates the same-origin
  policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the wrong domain.
  (CVE-2011-2362)

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 3.6.18. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * With previous versions of Firefox on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, the
  &quot;background-repeat&quot; CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) property did not work
  (such images were not displayed and repeated as expected). (BZ#698313)

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 3.6.18, which corrects these issues. After installing the
  update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.");
