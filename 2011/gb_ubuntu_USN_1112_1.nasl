  It was discovered that Firefox incorrectly handled certain JavaScript
  requests. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as
  the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0069)

  Ian Beer discovered a vulnerability in the memory handling of a certain
  types of documents. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run
  arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0070)

  Bob Clary, Henri Sivonen, Marco Bonardo, Mats Palmgren and Jesse Ruderman
  discovered several memory vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these
  to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0080)

  Aki Helin discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the HTML rendering code.
  An attacker could exploit these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user
  running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0074, CVE-2011-0075)

  Ian Beer discovered multiple overflow vulnerabilities. An attacker could
  exploit these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2011-0077, CVE-2011-0078)

  Martin Barbella discovered a memory vulnerability in the handling of
  certain DOM elements. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run
  arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0072)

  It was discovered that there were use-after-free vulnerabilities in
  Firefox's mChannel and mObserverList objects. An attacker could exploit
  these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2011-0065, CVE-2011-0066)

  It was discovered that there was a vulnerability in the handling of the
  nsTreeSelection element. An attacker serving malicious content could
  exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2011-0073)

  Paul Stone discovered a vulnerability in the handling of Java applets. An
  attacker could use this to mimic interaction with form autocomplete
  controls and steal entries from the form history. (CVE-2011-0067)

  Soroush Dalili discovered a vulnerability in the resource: protocol. This
  could potentially allow an attacker to load arbitrary files that were
  accessible to the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0071)

  Chris Evans discovered a vulnerability in Firefox's XSLT generate-id()
  function. An attacker could possibly use this vulnerability to make other
  attacks more reliable. (CVE-2011-1202)");
