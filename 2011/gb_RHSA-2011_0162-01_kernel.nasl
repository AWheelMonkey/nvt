tag_insight = "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:
  
  * A heap overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Transparent
  Inter-Process Communication protocol (TIPC) implementation. A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.
  (CVE-2010-3859, Important)
  
  * Missing sanity checks were found in gdth_ioctl_alloc() in the gdth driver
  in the Linux kernel. A local user with access to &quot;/dev/gdth&quot; on a 64-bit
  system could use these flaws to cause a denial of service or escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2010-4157, Moderate)
  
  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Bluetooth HCI UART
  driver in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
  to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4242, Moderate)
  
  * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collector for AF_UNIX
  sockets. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger a
  denial of service (out-of-memory condition). (CVE-2010-4249, Moderate)
  
  * Missing initialization flaws were found in the Linux kernel. A local,
  unprivileged user could use these flaws to cause information leaks.
  (CVE-2010-3876, CVE-2010-4072, CVE-2010-4073, CVE-2010-4075, CVE-2010-4080,
  CVE-2010-4083, CVE-2010-4158, Low)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank Alan Cox for reporting CVE-2010-4242; Vegard
  Nossum for reporting CVE-2010-4249; Vasiliy Kulikov for reporting
  CVE-2010-3876; Kees Cook for reporting CVE-2010-4072; and Dan Rosenberg for
  reporting CVE-2010-4073, CVE-2010-4075, CVE-2010-4080, CVE-2010-4083, and
  CVE-2010-4158.
  
  This update also fixes the following bugs:
  
  * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel where, if used in conjunction with
  another flaw that can result in a kernel Oops, could possibly lead to
  privilege escalation. It does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as the
  sysctl panic_on_oops variable is turned on by default. However, as a
  preventive measure if the variable is turned off by an administrator, this
  update addresses the issue. Red Hat would like to thank Nelson Elhage for
  reporting this vulnerability. (BZ#659568)
  
  * On Intel I/O Controller Hub 9 (ICH9) hardware, jumbo frame support is
  achieved by using page-based sk_buff buffers without any packet split. The
  entire frame data is copied to the page(s) rather than some to the
  skb-&gt;data area and some to the page(s) when performing a typical
  packet-split. T ...
