  Ryan Sweat discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled certain VLAN
  packets. On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted
  traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

  Timo Warns discovered that the EFI GUID partition table was not correctly
  parsed. A physically local attacker that could insert mountable devices
  could exploit this to crash the system or possibly gain root privileges.

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not
  correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to
  consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2213)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access
  restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
  information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2494)

  could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root
  privileges. (CVE-2011-2497)

  It was discovered that the wireless stack incorrectly verified SSID
  lengths. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service
  or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-2517)

  Ben Pfaff discovered that Classless Queuing Disciplines (qdiscs) were being

  system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2525)

  It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one
