  It was found that many applications embedding the Python interpreter did
  not specify a valid full path to the script or application when calling the
  PySys_SetArgv API function, which could result in the addition of the
  current working directory to the module search path (sys.path). A local
  attacker able to trick a victim into running such an application in an
  attacker-controlled directory could use this flaw to execute code with the
  victim's privileges. This update adds the PySys_SetArgvEx API. Developers
  can modify their applications to use this new API, which sets sys.argv
  without modifying sys.path. (CVE-2008-5983)

  Multiple flaws were found in the Python rgbimg module. If an application
  written in Python was using the rgbimg module and loaded a
  specially-crafted SGI image file, it could cause the application to crash
  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running the application. (CVE-2009-4134, CVE-2010-1449, CVE-2010-1450)

  Multiple flaws were found in the Python audioop module. Supplying certain
  inputs could cause the audioop module to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-1634, CVE-2010-2089)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * When starting a child process from the subprocess module in Python 2.4,
  the parent process could leak file descriptors if an error occurred. This
  update resolves the issue. (BZ#609017)

  * Prior to Python 2.7, programs that used &quot;ulimit -n&quot; to enable
  communication with large numbers of subprocesses could still monitor only
  1024 file descriptors at a time, which caused an exception:

    ValueError: filedescriptor out of range in select()

  This was due to the subprocess module using the &quot;select&quot; system call. The
  module now uses the &quot;poll&quot; system call, removing this limitation.
  (BZ#609020)

  * Prior to Python 2.5, the tarfile module failed to unpack tar files if the
  path was longer than 100 characters. This update backports the tarfile
  module from Python 2.5 and the issue no longer occurs. (BZ#263401)

  * The email module incorrectly implemented the logic for obtaining
  attachment file names: the get_filename() fallback for using the deprecated
  &quot;name&quot; parameter of the &quot;Content-Type&quot; header erroneously used the
  &quot;Content-Disposition&quot; header. This update backports a fix from Python 2.6,
  which resolves this issue. (BZ#644147)

  * Prior to version 2.5, Python's ...
