CVE-2011-2372
Mozilla Firefox before 3.6.23 and 4.x through 6, Thunderbird before
7.0, and SeaMonkey before 2.4 do not prevent the starting of a
download in response to the holding of the Enter key, which allows
user-assisted remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions
via a crafted web site.
CVE-2011-2995
Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine in Mozilla
Firefox before 3.6.23 and 4.x through 6, Thunderbird before 7.0, and
SeaMonkey before 2.4 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code via unknown vectors.
CVE-2011-2996
Unspecified vulnerability in the plugin API in Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x
before 3.6.23 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code via unknown vectors.
CVE-2011-2997
Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine in Mozilla
Firefox 6, Thunderbird before 7.0, and SeaMonkey before 2.4 allow
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown
vectors.
CVE-2011-2999
Mozilla Firefox before 3.6.23 and 4.x through 5, Thunderbird before
6.0, and SeaMonkey before 2.3 do not properly handle 'location' as the
name of a frame, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same
Origin Policy via a crafted web site, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2010-0170.
CVE-2011-3000
Mozilla Firefox before 3.6.23 and 4.x through 6, Thunderbird before
7.0, and SeaMonkey before 2.4 do not properly handle HTTP responses
that contain multiple Location, Content-Length, or Content-Disposition
headers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct HTTP
response splitting attacks via crafted header values.
CVE-2011-3001
Mozilla Firefox 4.x through 6, Thunderbird before 7.0, and SeaMonkey
before 2.4 do not prevent manual add-on installation in response to
the holding of the Enter key, which allows user-assisted remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a crafted web
site that triggers an unspecified internal error.
CVE-2011-3002
Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine (ANGLE), as used in Mozilla
Firefox before 7.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.4, does not validate the
return value of a GrowAtomTable function call, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code via vectors that trigger a memory-allocation
error and a resulting buffer overflow.
CVE-2011-3003
Mozilla Firefox before 7.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.4 allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code via an unspecified WebGL test case that
triggers a memory-allocation error and a resulting out-of-bounds write
operation.
CVE-2011-3004
The JSSubScriptLoader in Mozilla Firefox 4.x through 6 and SeaMonkey
before 2.4 does not properly handle XPCNativeWrappers during calls to
the loadSubScript method in an add-on, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to gain privileges via a crafted web site that
leverages certain unwrapping behavior.
CVE-2011-3005
Use-after-free vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 4.x through 6,
Thunderbird before 7.0, and SeaMonkey before 2.4 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code via crafted OGG headers in a .ogg file.
CVE-2011-3232
YARR, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 7.0, Thunderbird before 7.0,
and SeaMonkey before 2.4, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via
crafted JavaScript.");
