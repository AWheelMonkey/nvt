vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-
supplied input.

A remote attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issue to
execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting
user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the
attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to
launch other attacks.

Exploiting the local file-include issue allows the attacker to view
and subsequently execute local files within the context of the
webserver process.

TinyWebGallery 1.8.3 is vulnerable. Other versions may also be
affected.");
