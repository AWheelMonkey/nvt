tag_insight = "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  Security fixes:
  
  * a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local
  users in the unconfined_t domain to map low memory areas even if the
  mmap_min_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local
  exploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)
  
  * a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the eCryptfs implementation
  in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a local
  denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2908, Important)
  
  * a flaw was found in the NFSv4 implementation. The kernel would do an
  unnecessary permission check after creating a file. This check would
  usually fail and leave the file with the permission bits set to random
  values. Note: This is a server-side only issue. (CVE-2009-3286, Important)
  
  * a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following
  functions in the Linux kernel: pipe_read_open(), pipe_write_open(), and
  pipe_rdwr_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i_pipe pointer could
  be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
  reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
  privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)
  
  * a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux
  kernel. pci_unmap_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
  space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
  abuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.
  (CVE-2009-3613, Important)
  
  * missing initialization flaws were found in the Linux kernel. Padding data
  in several core network structures was not initialized properly before
  being sent to user-space. These flaws could lead to information leaks.
  (CVE-2009-3228, Moderate)
  
  Bug fixes:
  
  * with network bonding in the &quot;balance-tlb&quot; or &quot;balance-alb&quot; mode, the
  primary setting for the primary slave device was lost when said device was
  brought down. Bringing the slave back up did not restore the primary
  setting. (BZ#517971)
  
  * some faulty serial device hardware caused systems running the kernel-xen
  kernel to take a very long time to boot. (BZ#524153)
  
  * a caching bug in nfs_readdir() may have caused NFS clients to see
  duplicate files or not see all files in a directory. (BZ#526960)
  
  * the RHSA-2009:1243 update removed the mpt_msi_enable option, preventing
  certain scripts from running. This update adds the o ...
