  oggparsevorbis.c in FFmpeg 0.5 does not properly perform certain
  pointer arithmetic, which might allow remote attackers to obtain
  sensitive memory contents and cause a denial of service via a crafted
  file that triggers an out-of-bounds read. (CVE-2009-4632)

  vorbis_dec.c in FFmpeg 0.5 uses an assignment operator when a
  comparison operator was intended, which might allow remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via
  a crafted file that modifies a loop counter and triggers a heap-based
  buffer overflow. (CVE-2009-4633)

  Multiple integer underflows in FFmpeg 0.5 allow remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
  crafted file that (1) bypasses a validation check in vorbis_dec.c
  and triggers a wraparound of the stack pointer, or (2) access a
  pointer from out-of-bounds memory in mov.c, related to an elst tag
  that appears before a tag that creates a stream. (CVE-2009-4634)

  FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and
  possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted MOV container with
  improperly ordered tags that cause (1) mov.c and (2) utils.c to use
  inconsistent codec types and identifiers, which causes the mp3 decoder
  to process a pointer for a video structure, leading to a stack-based
  buffer overflow. (CVE-2009-4635)

  FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (hang)
  via a crafted file that triggers an infinite loop. (CVE-2009-4636)

  Array index error in vorbis_dec.c in FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary
  code via a crafted Vorbis file that triggers an out-of-bounds
  read. (CVE-2009-4640)

  flicvideo.c in libavcodec 0.6 and earlier in FFmpeg, as used in MPlayer
  and other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
  via a crafted flic file, related to an arbitrary offset dereference
  vulnerability. (CVE-2010-3429)

  libavcodec/vorbis_dec.c in the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg 0.6.1
  and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (application crash) via a crafted .ogg file, related to the
  vorbis_floor0_decode function. (CVE-2010-4704)

  Fix heap corruption crashes (CVE-2011-0722)

  Fix invalid reads in VC-1 decoding (CVE-2011-0723)
