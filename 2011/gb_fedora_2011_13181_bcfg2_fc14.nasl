tag_insight = "Bcfg2 helps system administrators produce a consistent, reproducible,
  and verifiable description of their environment, and offers
  visualization and reporting tools to aid in day-to-day administrative
  tasks. It is the fifth generation of configuration management tools
  developed in the Mathematics and Computer Science Division of Argonne
  National Laboratory.

  It is based on an operational model in which the specification can be
  used to validate and optionally change the state of clients, but in a
  feature unique to bcfg2 the client's response to the specification can
  also be used to assess the completeness of the specification. Using
  this feature, bcfg2 provides an objective measure of how good a job an
  administrator has done in specifying the configuration of client
  systems. Bcfg2 is therefore built to help administrators construct an
  accurate, comprehensive specification.
  
  Bcfg2 has been designed from the ground up to support gentle
  reconciliation between the specification and current client states. It
  is designed to gracefully cope with manual system modifications.
  
  Finally, due to the rapid pace of updates on modern networks, client
  systems are constantly changing; if required in your environment,
  Bcfg2 can enable the construction of complex change management and
  deployment strategies.";
