tag_insight = "SquirrelMail is an easy-to-configure, standards-based, webmail package
  written in PHP. It includes built-in PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP
  protocols, and pure HTML 4.0 page-rendering (with no JavaScript required)
  for maximum browser-compatibility, strong MIME support, address books, and
  folder manipulation.

  Ivan Markovic discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in SquirrelMail
  caused by insufficient HTML mail sanitization. A remote attacker could send
  a specially-crafted HTML mail or attachment that could cause a user's Web
  browser to execute a malicious script in the context of the SquirrelMail
  session when that email or attachment was opened by the user.
  (CVE-2008-2379)
  
  It was discovered that SquirrelMail allowed cookies over insecure
  connections (ie did not restrict cookies to HTTPS connections). An attacker
  who controlled the communication channel between a user and the
  SquirrelMail server, or who was able to sniff the user's network
  communication, could use this flaw to obtain the user's session cookie, if
  a user made an HTTP request to the server. (CVE-2008-3663)
  
  Note: After applying this update, all session cookies set for SquirrelMail
  sessions started over HTTPS connections will have the &quot;secure&quot; flag set.
  That is, browsers will only send such cookies over an HTTPS connection. If
  needed, you can revert to the previous behavior by setting the
  configuration option &quot;$only_secure_cookies&quot; to &quot;false&quot; in SquirrelMail's
  /etc/squirrelmail/config.php configuration file.
  
  Users of squirrelmail should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues.";
