  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Brad Spengler discovered that the kernel did not correctly account for
  userspace memory allocations during exec() calls. A local attacker could
  exploit this to consume all system memory, leading to a denial of service.
  (CVE-2010-4243)

  Alexander Duyck discovered that the Intel Gigabit Ethernet driver did not
  correctly handle certain configurations. If such a device was configured
  without VLANs, a remote attacker could crash the system, leading to a
  denial of service. (CVE-2010-4263)

  Nelson Elhage discovered that Econet did not correctly handle AUN packets
  over UDP. A local attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash
  the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4342)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that IRDA did not correctly check the size of
  buffers. On non-x86 systems, a local attacker could exploit this to read
  kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-4529)

  Dan Rosenburg discovered that the CAN subsystem leaked kernel addresses
  into the /proc filesystem. A local attacker could use this to increase the
  chances of a successful memory corruption exploit. (CVE-2010-4565)

  Goldwyn Rodrigues discovered that the OCFS2 filesystem did not correctly
  clear memory when writing certain file holes. A local attacker could
  exploit this to read uninitialized data from the disk, leading to a loss of
  privacy. (CVE-2011-0463)

  Jens Kuehnel discovered that the InfiniBand driver contained a race
  condition. On systems using InfiniBand, a local attacker could send
  specially crafted requests to crash the system, leading to a denial of
  service. (CVE-2011-0695)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that XFS did not correctly initialize memory. A
  local attacker could make crafted ioctl calls to leak portions of kernel
  stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-0711)

  Kees Cook reported that /proc/pid/stat did not correctly filter certain
  memory locations. A local attacker could determine the memory layout of
  processes in an attempt to increase the chances of a successful memory
  corruption exploit. (CVE-2011-0726)

  Matthiew Herrb discovered that the drm modeset interface did not correctly
  handle a signed comparison. A local attacker could exploit this to crash
  the system or possibly gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-1013)

  Marek Ol&#353;&#225;k discovered that the Radeon GPU drivers did not correctly
  validate certain registers. On systems with specific hardware, a local
  attacker could exploit this to write to arbitrary video memory.
