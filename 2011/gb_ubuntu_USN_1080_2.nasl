  Original advisory details:

  Thomas Pollet discovered that the RDS network protocol did not check
  certain iovec buffers. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the
  system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user. (CVE-2010-3865)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Linux kernel X.25 implementation did
  not correctly clear kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this to
  read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3875)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Linux kernel sockets implementation did
  not properly initialize certain structures. A local attacker could exploit
  this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
  (CVE-2010-3876)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the TIPC interface did not correctly
  initialize certain structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read
  kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3877)

  Nelson Elhage discovered that the Linux kernel IPv4 implementation did not
  properly audit certain bytecodes in netlink messages. A local attacker
  could exploit this to cause the kernel to hang, leading to a denial of
  service. (CVE-2010-3880)

  It was discovered that multithreaded exec did not handle CPU timers
  correctly. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading
  to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4248)

  Krishna Gudipati discovered that the bfa adapter driver did not correctly
  initialize certain structures. A local attacker could read files in /sys to
  crash the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4343)

  Tavis Ormandy discovered that the install_special_mapping function could
  bypass the mmap_min_addr restriction. A local attacker could exploit this
  to mmap 4096 bytes below the mmap_min_addr area, possibly improving the
  chances of performing NULL pointer dereference attacks. (CVE-2010-4346)

  It was discovered that the ICMP stack did not correctly handle certain
  unreachable messages. If a remote attacker were able to acquire a socket
  lock, they could send specially crafted traffic that would crash the
  system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4526)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the OSS subsystem did not handle name
  termination correctly. A local attacker could exploit this crash the system
  or gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-4527)

  Dan Carpenter discovered that the Infiniband driver did not correctly
  handle certain requests. A local user could exploit this to crash the
  system or potentially gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-4649, CVE-2011-1044)");
