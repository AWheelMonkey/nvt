  A flaw was found in the Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) registry
  implementation. A remote RMI client could use this flaw to execute
  arbitrary code on the RMI server running the registry. (CVE-2011-3556)
  
  A flaw was found in the Java RMI registry implementation. A remote RMI
  client could use this flaw to execute code on the RMI server with
  unrestricted privileges. (CVE-2011-3557)
  
  A flaw was found in the IIOP (Internet Inter-Orb Protocol) deserialization
  code. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox could
  use this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions by deserializing
  specially-crafted input. (CVE-2011-3521)
  
  It was found that the Java ScriptingEngine did not properly restrict the
  privileges of sandboxed applications. An untrusted Java application or
  applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass sandbox
  restrictions. (CVE-2011-3544)
  
  A flaw was found in the AWTKeyStroke implementation. An untrusted Java
  application or applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass
  sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2011-3548)
  
  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the Java2D code used to perform transformations of graphic shapes
  and images. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox
  could use this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2011-3551)
  
  An insufficient error checking flaw was found in the unpacker for JAR files
  in pack200 format. A specially-crafted JAR file could use this flaw to
  crash the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
  with JVM privileges. (CVE-2011-3554)
  
  It was found that HttpsURLConnection did not perform SecurityManager checks
  in the setSSLSocketFactory method. An untrusted Java application or applet
  running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass connection restrictions
  defined in the policy. (CVE-2011-3560)
  
  A flaw was found in the way the SSL 3 and TLS 1.0 protocols used block
  ciphers in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode. An attacker able to perform a
  chosen plain text attack against a connection mixing trusted and untrusted
  data could use this flaw to recover portions of the trusted data sent over
  the connection. (CVE-2011-3389)
  
  Note: This update mitigates the CVE-2011-3389 issue by splitting the first
  application data record byte to a separate SSL/TLS protocol record. This
  mitigation may cause compatibility issues wi ...
