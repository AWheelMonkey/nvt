tag_insight = "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always check the return value of the
  bn_wexpand() function. An attacker able to trigger a memory allocation
  failure in that function could cause an application using the OpenSSL
  library to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2009-3245)
  
  A flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure
  Sockets Layer) protocols handled session renegotiation. A man-in-the-middle
  attacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's
  session (for example, an HTTPS connection to a website). This could force
  the server to process an attacker's request as if authenticated using the
  victim's credentials. This update addresses this flaw by implementing the
  TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension, as defined in RFC 5746.
  (CVE-2009-3555)
  
  Refer to the following Knowledgebase article for additional details about
  the CVE-2009-3555 flaw: http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491
  
  A missing return value check flaw was discovered in OpenSSL, that could
  possibly cause OpenSSL to call a Kerberos library function with invalid
  arguments, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference crash in the MIT
  Kerberos library. In certain configurations, a remote attacker could use
  this flaw to crash a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL by requesting Kerberos
  cipher suites during the TLS handshake. (CVE-2010-0433)
  
  All OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. For the update to take effect,
  all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system
  rebooted.";
