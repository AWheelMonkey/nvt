tag_insight = "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  Security fixes:
  
  * several flaws were found in the way the Linux kernel CIFS implementation
  handles Unicode strings. CIFS clients convert Unicode strings sent by a
  server to their local character sets, and then write those strings into
  memory. If a malicious server sent a long enough string, it could write
  past the end of the target memory region and corrupt other memory areas,
  possibly leading to a denial of service or privilege escalation on the
  client mounting the CIFS share. (CVE-2009-1439, CVE-2009-1633, Important)
  
  * the Linux kernel Network File System daemon (nfsd) implementation did not
  drop the CAP_MKNOD capability when handling requests from local,
  unprivileged users. This flaw could possibly lead to an information leak or
  privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-1072, Moderate)
  
  * Frank Filz reported the NFSv4 client was missing a file permission check
  for the execute bit in some situations. This could allow local,
  unprivileged users to run non-executable files on NFSv4 mounted file
  systems. (CVE-2009-1630, Moderate)
  
  * a missing check was found in the hypervisor_callback() function in the
  Linux kernel provided by the kernel-xen package. This could cause a denial
  of service of a 32-bit guest if an application running in that guest
  accesses a certain memory location in the kernel. (CVE-2009-1758, Moderate)
  
  * a flaw was found in the AGPGART driver. The agp_generic_alloc_page() and
  agp_generic_alloc_pages() functions did not zero out the memory pages they
  allocate, which may later be available to user-space processes. This flaw
  could possibly lead to an information leak. (CVE-2009-1192, Low)
  
  Bug fixes:
  
  * a race in the NFS client between destroying cached access rights and
  unmounting an NFS file system could have caused a system crash. &quot;Busy
  inodes&quot; messages may have been logged. (BZ#498653)
  
  * nanosleep() could sleep several milliseconds less than the specified time
  on Intel Itanium-based systems. (BZ#500349)
  
  * LEDs for disk drives in AHCI mode may have displayed a fault state when
  there were no faults. (BZ#500120)
  
  * ptrace_do_wait() reported tasks were stopped each time the process doing
  the trace called wait(), instead of reporting it once. (BZ#486945)
  
  * epoll_wait() may have caused a system lockup and problems for
  applications. (BZ#497322)
  
  * missing capabilities could possibly allow users with an fsuid other than
  0 to perform actions on some file system types that would otherwise be
  pr ...
