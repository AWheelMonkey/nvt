tag_insight = "Evolution is the integrated collection of e-mail, calendaring, contact
  management, communications, and personal information management (PIM) tools
  for the GNOME desktop environment.

  Evolution Data Server provides a unified back-end for applications which
  interact with contacts, task and calendar information. Evolution Data
  Server was originally developed as a back-end for Evolution, but is now
  used by multiple other applications.
  
  Evolution did not properly check the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail
  Extensions (S/MIME) signatures used for public key encryption and signing
  of e-mail messages. An attacker could use this flaw to spoof a signature by
  modifying the text of the e-mail message displayed to the user. (CVE-2009-0547)
  
  It was discovered that evolution did not properly validate NTLM (NT LAN
  Manager) authentication challenge packets. A malicious server using NTLM
  authentication could cause evolution to disclose portions of its memory or
  crash during user authentication. (CVE-2009-0582)
  
  Multiple integer overflow flaws which could cause heap-based buffer
  overflows were found in the Base64 encoding routines used by evolution and
  evolution-data-server. This could cause evolution, or an application using
  evolution-data-server, to crash, or, possibly, execute an arbitrary code
  when large untrusted data blocks were Base64-encoded. (CVE-2009-0587)
  
  All users of evolution and evolution-data-server are advised to upgrade to
  these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these
  issues. All running instances of evolution and evolution-data-server must
  be restarted for the update to take effect.";
