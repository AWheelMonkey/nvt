tag_insight = "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update addresses the following security issues:
  
  * a buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel Partial Reliable Stream
  Control Transmission Protocol (PR-SCTP) implementation. This could,
  potentially, lead to a denial of service if a Forward-TSN chunk is received
  with a large stream ID. (CVE-2009-0065, Important)
  
  * a memory leak was found in keyctl handling. A local, unprivileged user
  could use this flaw to deplete kernel memory, eventually leading to a
  denial of service. (CVE-2009-0031, Important)
  
  * a deficiency was found in the Remote BIOS Update (RBU) driver for Dell
  systems. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of
  service by reading zero bytes from the image_type or packet_size file in
  &quot;/sys/devices/platform/dell_rbu/&quot;. (CVE-2009-0322, Important)
  
  * a deficiency was found in the libATA implementation. This could,
  potentially, lead to a denial of service. Note: by default, &quot;/dev/sg*&quot;
  devices are accessible only to the root user. (CVE-2008-5700, Low)
  
  This update also fixes the following bugs:
  
  * when the hypervisor changed a page table entry (pte) mapping from
  read-only to writable via a make_writable hypercall, accessing the changed
  page immediately following the change caused a spurious page fault. When
  trying to install a para-virtualized Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 guest on a
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 dom0 host, this fault crashed the installer
  with a kernel backtrace. With this update, the &quot;spurious&quot; page fault is
  handled properly. (BZ#483748)
  
  * net_rx_action could detect its cpu poll_list as non-empty, but have that
  same list reduced to empty by the poll_napi path. This resulted in garbage
  data being returned when net_rx_action calls list_entry, which subsequently
  resulted in several possible crash conditions. The race condition in the
  network code which caused this has been fixed. (BZ#475970, BZ#479681 &amp;
  BZ#480741)
  
  * a misplaced memory barrier at unlock_buffer() could lead to a concurrent
  h_refcounter update which produced a reference counter leak and, later, a
  double free in ext3_xattr_release_block(). Consequent to the double free,
  ext3 reported an error
  
      ext3_free_blocks_sb: bit already cleared for block [block number]
  
  and mounted itself as read-only. With this update, the memory barrier is
  now placed before the buffer head lock bit, forcing the write order and
  preventing the double free. (BZ#476533)
  
  * when the iptables ...
