  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"It was discovered that the /proc filesystem did not correctly handle
  permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open
  files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges,
  potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional
  vulnerabilities. (CVE-2011-1020)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Bluetooth stack did not correctly clear
  memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory,
  leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-1078)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Bluetooth stack did not correctly check
  that device name strings were NULL terminated. A local attacker could
  exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or leak
  contents of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
  (CVE-2011-1079)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that bridge network filtering did not check that
  name fields were NULL terminated. A local attacker could exploit this to
  leak contents of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
  (CVE-2011-1080)

  Johan Hovold discovered that the DCCP network stack did not correctly
  handle certain packet combinations. A remote attacker could send specially
  crafted network traffic that would crash the system, leading to a denial of
  service. (CVE-2011-1093)

  Peter Huewe discovered that the TPM device did not correctly initialize
  memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel heap memory
  contents, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-1160)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IRDA subsystem did not correctly check
  certain field sizes. If a system was using IRDA, a remote attacker could
  send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root privileges.
  (CVE-2011-1180)

  Ryan Sweat discovered that the GRO code did not correctly validate memory.
  In some configurations on systems using VLANs, a remote attacker could send
  specially crafted traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of
  service. (CVE-2011-1478)

  It was discovered that the security fix for CVE-2010-4250 introduced a
  regression. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the system,
  leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1479)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the X.25 Rose network stack did not correctly
  handle certain fields. If a system was running with Rose enabled, a remote
  attacker could send specially crafted traffic to gain root privileges.
  (CVE-2011-1493)

  It was discovered that the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
  implementation incorrectly calculated length ...
