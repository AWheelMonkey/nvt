  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Dan Rosenberg discovered that the RDS network protocol did not correctly
  check certain parameters. A local attacker could exploit this gain root
  privileges. (CVE-2010-3904)

  Nelson Elhage discovered several problems with the Acorn Econet protocol
  driver. A local user could cause a denial of service via a NULL pointer
  dereference, escalate privileges by overflowing the kernel stack, and
  assign Econet addresses to arbitrary interfaces. (CVE-2010-3848,
  CVE-2010-3849, CVE-2010-3850)

  Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly validate
  memory ranges on 64bit kernels when allocating memory on behalf of 32bit
  system calls. On a 64bit system, a local attacker could perform malicious
  multicast getsockopt calls to gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-3081)

  Tavis Ormandy discovered that the IRDA subsystem did not correctly shut
  down. A local attacker could exploit this to cause the system to crash or
  possibly gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-2954)

  Brad Spengler discovered that the wireless extensions did not correctly
  validate certain request sizes. A local attacker could exploit this to read
  portions of kernel memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-2955)

  Tavis Ormandy discovered that the session keyring did not correctly check
  for its parent. On systems without a default session keyring, a local
  attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of
  service. (CVE-2010-2960)

  Kees Cook discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver did not correctly
  validate memory regions. A local attacker with access to the video card
  could read and write arbitrary kernel memory to gain root privileges.
  (CVE-2010-2962)

  Kees Cook discovered that the V4L1 32bit compat interface did not correctly
  validate certain parameters. A local attacker on a 64bit system with access
  to a video device could exploit this to gain root privileges.
  (CVE-2010-2963)

  Robert Swiecki discovered that ftrace did not correctly handle mutexes. A
  local attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel, leading to a denial
  of service. (CVE-2010-3079)

  Tavis Ormandy discovered that the OSS sequencer device did not correctly
  shut down. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or
  possibly gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-3080)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the CD driver did not correctly check
  parameters. A local attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary kernel
  memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3437)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that SCTP did not correctly handle HMAC
