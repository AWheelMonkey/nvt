tag_insight = "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  Security fixes:
  
  * when fput() was called to close a socket, the __scm_destroy() function in
  the Linux kernel could make indirect recursive calls to itself. This could,
  potentially, lead to a denial of service issue. (CVE-2008-5029, Important)
  
  * the sendmsg() function in the Linux kernel did not block during UNIX
  socket garbage collection. This could, potentially, lead to a local denial
  of service. (CVE-2008-5300, Important)
  
  * the exit_notify() function in the Linux kernel did not properly reset the
  exit signal if a process executed a set user ID (setuid) application before
  exiting. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to elevate their
  privileges. (CVE-2009-1337, Important)
  
  * a flaw was found in the Intel PRO/1000 network driver in the Linux
  kernel. Frames with sizes near the MTU of an interface may be split across
  multiple hardware receive descriptors. Receipt of such a frame could leak
  through a validation check, leading to a corruption of the length check. A
  remote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted packet that
  would cause a denial of service or code execution. (CVE-2009-1385,
  Important)
  
  * the ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT and MMAP_PAGE_ZERO flags were not cleared when a
  setuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use
  this flaw to bypass the mmap_min_addr protection mechanism and perform a
  NULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout
  Randomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)
  
  * it was discovered that, when executing a new process, the clear_child_tid
  pointer in the Linux kernel is not cleared. If this pointer points to a
  writable portion of the memory of the new program, the kernel could corrupt
  four bytes of memory, possibly leading to a local denial of service or
  privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-2848, Important)
  
  * missing initialization flaws were found in getname() implementations in
  the IrDA sockets, AppleTalk DDP protocol, NET/ROM protocol, and ROSE
  protocol implementations in the Linux kernel. Certain data structures in
  these getname() implementations were not initialized properly before being
  copied to user-space. These flaws could lead to an information leak.
  (CVE-2009-3002, Important)
  
  * a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following
  functions in the Linux kernel: pipe_read_open(), pipe_write_open(), and
  pipe_rdwr_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i_pipe pointer could
  be release ...
