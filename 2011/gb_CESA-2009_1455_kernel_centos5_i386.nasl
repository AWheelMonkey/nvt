tag_insight = "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  Security fix:
  
  * a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Multiple Devices (md)
  driver in the Linux kernel. If the &quot;suspend_lo&quot; or &quot;suspend_hi&quot; file on the
  sysfs file system (&quot;/sys/&quot;) is modified when the disk array is inactive, it
  could lead to a local denial of service or privilege escalation. Note: By
  default, only the root user can write to the files mentioned above.
  (CVE-2009-2849, Moderate)
  
  Bug fixes:
  
  * a bug in nlm_lookup_host() could lead to un-reclaimed locks on file
  systems, resulting in umount failing and NFS service relocation issues for
  clusters. (BZ#517967)
  
  * a bug in the sky2 driver prevented the phy from being reset properly on
  some hardware when it hanged, preventing a link from coming back up.
  (BZ#517976)
  
  * disabling MSI-X for qla2xxx also disabled MSI interrupts. (BZ#519782)
  
  * performance issues with reads when using the qlge driver on PowerPC
  systems. A system hang could also occur during reboot. (BZ#519783)
  
  * unreliable time keeping for Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines.
  The KVM pvclock code is now used to detect/correct lost ticks. (BZ#520685)
  
  * /proc/cpuinfo was missing flags for new features in supported processors,
  possibly preventing the operating system and applications from getting the
  best performance. (BZ#520686)
  
  * reading/writing with a serial loopback device on a certain IBM system did
  not work unless booted with &quot;pnpacpi=off&quot;. (BZ#520905)
  
  * mlx4_core failed to load on systems with more than 32 CPUs. (BZ#520906)
  
  * on big-endian platforms, interfaces using the mlx4_en driver and Large
  Receive Offload (LRO) did not handle VLAN traffic properly (a segmentation
  fault in the VLAN stack in the kernel occurred). (BZ#520908)
  
  * due to a lock being held for a long time, some systems may have
  experienced &quot;BUG: soft lockup&quot; messages under very heavy load. (BZ#520919)
  
  * incorrect APIC timer calibration may have caused a system hang during
  boot, as well as the system time becoming faster or slower. A warning is
  now provided. (BZ#521238)
  
  * a Fibre Channel device re-scan via 'echo &quot;---&quot; &gt; /sys/class/scsi_host/
  host[x]/scan' may not complete after hot adding a drive, leading to soft
  lockups (&quot;BUG: soft lockup detected&quot;). (BZ#521239)
  
  * the Broadcom BCM5761 network device was unable to be initialized
  properly; therefore, the associated interface could not obtain an IP
  address via DHCP,  ...
