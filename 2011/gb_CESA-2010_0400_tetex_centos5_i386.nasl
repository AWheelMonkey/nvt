tag_insight = "teTeX is an implementation of TeX. TeX takes a text file and a set of
  formatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice
  Independent (DVI) file as output.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way teTeX processed
  special commands when converting DVI files into PostScript. An attacker
  could create a malicious DVI file that would cause the dvips executable to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-0739,
  CVE-2010-1440)
  
  Multiple array index errors were found in the way teTeX converted DVI files
  into the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format. An attacker could create a
  malicious DVI file that would cause the dvipng executable to crash.
  (CVE-2010-0829)
  
  teTeX embeds a copy of Xpdf, an open source Portable Document Format (PDF)
  file viewer, to allow adding images in PDF format to the generated PDF
  documents. The following issues affect Xpdf code:
  
  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a
  local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a
  specially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.
  (CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-1179)
  
  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf. If a local user
  generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a specially-crafted
  PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0791,
  CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)
  
  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a
  local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a
  specially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.
  (CVE-2009-0195)
  
  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a
  local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a
  specially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.
  (CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-1182)
  
  Multiple flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder that could lead to the
  freeing of arbitrary memory. If a local user generated a PDF file from a
  TeX document, referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it would cause
  Xpdf to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges
  of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0166, CVE-2009-1180)
