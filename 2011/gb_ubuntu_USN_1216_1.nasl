  initialize structure memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read
  portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
  (CVE-2010-4076, CVE-2010-4077)

  Alex Shi and Eric Dumazet discovered that the network stack did not
  correctly handle packet backlogs. A remote attacker could exploit this by
  sending a large amount of network traffic to cause the system to run out of
  memory, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4251, CVE-2010-4805)

  It was discovered that the /proc filesystem did not correctly handle
  permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open
  files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges,
  potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional
  vulnerabilities. (CVE-2011-1020)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the X.25 Rose network stack did not correctly
  handle certain fields. If a system was running with Rose enabled, a remote
  attacker could send specially crafted traffic to gain root privileges.
  (CVE-2011-1493)

  Timo Warns discovered that the GUID partition parsing routines did not
  correctly validate certain structures. A local attacker with physical
  access could plug in a specially crafted block device to crash the system,
  leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1577)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not
  correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to
  consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2213)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats listeners were not correctly
  handled. A local attacker could expoit this to exhaust memory and CPU
  resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2484)

  It was discovered that Bluetooth l2cap and rfcomm did not correctly
  initialize structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions
  of the kernel stack, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2492)

  Mauro Carvalho Chehab discovered that the si4713 radio driver did not
  correctly check the length of memory copies. If this hardware was
  available, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or gain
  root privileges. (CVE-2011-2700)

  Herbert Xu discovered that certain fields were incorrectly handled when
  Generic Receive Offload (CVE-2011-2723)

  The performance counter subsystem did not correctly handle certain
  counters. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading
  to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2918)");
