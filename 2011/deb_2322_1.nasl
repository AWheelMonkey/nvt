tag_insight = "Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Bugzilla, a web-based bug
tracking system.

CVE-2010-4572

By inserting particular strings into certain URLs, it was
possible to inject both headers and content to any
browser.

CVE-2010-4567, CVE-2011-0048

Bugzilla has a URL field that can contain several types
of URL, including javascript: and data: URLs. However,
it does not make javascript: and data: URLs into
clickable links, to protect against cross-site scripting
attacks or other attacks. It was possible to bypass this
protection by adding spaces into the URL in places that
Bugzilla did not expect them. Also, javascript: and
data: links were *always* shown as clickable to
logged-out users.

CVE-2010-4568

It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to
any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short
enough that the attack is highly effective).

CVE-2011-0046

Various pages were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
Forgery attacks. Most of these issues are not as serious
as previous CSRF vulnerabilities.

CVE-2011-2978

When a user changes his email address, Bugzilla trusts
a user-modifiable field for obtaining the current e-mail
address to send a confirmation message to. If an attacker
has access to the session of another user (for example,
if that user left their browser window open in a public
place), the attacker could alter this field to cause
the email-change notification to go to their own address.
This means that the user would not be notified that his
account had its email address changed by the attacker.

CVE-2011-2381

For flagmails only, attachment descriptions with a newline
in them could lead to the injection of crafted headers in
email notifications when an attachment flag is edited.

CVE-2011-2379

Bugzilla uses an alternate host for attachments when
viewing them in raw format to prevent cross-site scripting
attacks. This alternate host is now also used when viewing
patches in Raw Unified mode because Internet Explorer 8
and older, and Safari before 5.0.6 do content sniffing,
which could lead to the execution of malicious code.

CVE-2011-2380 CVE-201-2979

Normally, a group name is confidential and is only visible
to members of the group, and to non-members if the group
is used in bugs. By crafting the URL when creating or
editing a bug, it was possible to guess if a group existed
or not, even for groups which weren't used in bugs and so
which were supposed to remain confidential.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), it has not been practical to
backport patches to fix these bugs. Users of bugzilla on lenny are 
strongly advised to upgrade to the version in the squeeze distribution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.2.0-4.4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
the bugzilla packages have been removed.

We recommend that you upgrade your bugzilla packages.";
