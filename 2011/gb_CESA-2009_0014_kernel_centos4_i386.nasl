tag_insight = "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update addresses the following security issues:
  
  * the sendmsg() function in the Linux kernel did not block during UNIX
  socket garbage collection. This could, potentially, lead to a local denial
  of service. (CVE-2008-5300, Important)
  
  * when fput() was called to close a socket, the __scm_destroy() function in
  the Linux kernel could make indirect recursive calls to itself. This could,
  potentially, lead to a local denial of service. (CVE-2008-5029, Important)
  
  * a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel virtual file system (VFS)
  implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to make a
  series of file creations within deleted directories, possibly causing a
  denial of service. (CVE-2008-3275, Moderate)
  
  * a buffer underflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel IB700 SBC watchdog
  timer driver. This deficiency could lead to a possible information leak. By
  default, the &quot;/dev/watchdog&quot; device is accessible only to the root user.
  (CVE-2008-5702, Low)
  
  * the hfs and hfsplus file systems code failed to properly handle corrupted
  data structures. This could, potentially, lead to a local denial of
  service. (CVE-2008-4933, CVE-2008-5025, Low)
  
  * a flaw was found in the hfsplus file system implementation. This could,
  potentially, lead to a local denial of service when write operations were
  performed. (CVE-2008-4934, Low)
  
  This update also fixes the following bugs:
  
  * when running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6 and 4.7 on some systems running
  Intel® CPUs, the cpuspeed daemon did not run, preventing the CPU speed from
  being changed, such as not being reduced to an idle state when not in use.
  
  * mmap() could be used to gain access to beyond the first megabyte of RAM,
  due to insufficient checks in the Linux kernel code. Checks have been added
  to prevent this.
  
  * attempting to turn keyboard LEDs on and off rapidly on keyboards with
  slow keyboard controllers, may have caused key presses to fail.
  
  * after migrating a hypervisor guest, the MAC address table was not
  updated, causing packet loss and preventing network connections to the
  guest. Now, a gratuitous ARP request is sent after migration. This
  refreshes the ARP caches, minimizing network downtime.
  
  * writing crash dumps with diskdump may have caused a kernel panic on
  Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) systems with certain memory
  configurations.
  
  * on big-endian systems, such as PowerPC, the getsockopt() function
  incorrectly returned 0 depending on  ...
