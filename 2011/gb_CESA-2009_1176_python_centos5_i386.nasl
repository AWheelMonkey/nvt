  language.

  When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization flaw was
  revealed in the Python string object implementation that led to a buffer
  overflow. The missing check for negative size values meant the Python
  memory allocator could allocate less memory than expected. This could
  result in arbitrary code execution with the Python interpreter's
  privileges. (CVE-2008-1887)
  
  Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python Unicode
  string processing and in the Python Unicode and string object
  implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
  service (Python application crash). (CVE-2008-3142, CVE-2008-5031)
  
  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop module. If
  a Python application used the imageop module to process untrusted images,
  it could cause the application to disclose sensitive information, crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's
  privileges. (CVE-2007-4965, CVE-2008-4864)
  
  Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the Python
  snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use these flaws to
  cause a denial of service (memory corruption). (CVE-2008-3144)
  
  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python modules. An
  attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of service (Python
  application crash). (CVE-2008-2315, CVE-2008-3143)
  
  An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was found
  in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application requested
  the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression stream, it could
  cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
  with the Python interpreter's privileges. (CVE-2008-1721)
  
  A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python locale
  module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
  NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data stored in
  the memory of a Python application using this function. (CVE-2007-2052)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank David Remahl of the Apple Product Security team
  for responsibly reporting the CVE-2008-2315 issue.
  
  All Python users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.";
