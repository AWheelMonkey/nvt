  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Linux kernel TIPC implementation
  contained multiple integer signedness errors. A local attacker could
  exploit this to gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-3859)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that multiple terminal ioctls did not correctly
  initialize structure memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read
  portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
  (CVE-2010-4075, CVE-2010-4076, CVE-2010-4077)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the socket filters did not correctly
  initialize structure memory. A local attacker could create malicious
  filters to read portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of
  privacy. (CVE-2010-4158)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Linux kernel L2TP implementation
  contained multiple integer signedness errors. A local attacker could
  exploit this to to crash the kernel, or possibly gain root privileges.
  (CVE-2010-4160)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that certain iovec operations did not calculate
  page counts correctly. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the
  system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4162)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the SCSI subsystem did not correctly validate
  iov segments. A local attacker with access to a SCSI device could send
  specially crafted requests to crash the system, leading to a denial of
  service. (CVE-2010-4163, CVE-2010-4668)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the RDS protocol did not correctly check
  ioctl arguments. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,
  leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4175)

  Alan Cox discovered that the HCI UART driver did not correctly check if a
  write operation was available. If the mmap_min-addr sysctl was changed from
  the Ubuntu default to a value of 0, a local attacker could exploit this
  flaw to gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-4242)

  Brad Spengler discovered that the kernel did not correctly account for
  userspace memory allocations during exec() calls. A local attacker could
  exploit this to consume all system memory, leading to a denial of service.
  (CVE-2010-4243)

  Alex Shi and Eric Dumazet discovered that the network stack did not
  correctly handle packet backlogs. A remote attacker could exploit this by
  sending a large amount of network traffic to cause the system to run out of
  memory, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4251, CVE-2010-4805)

  It was discovered that the ICMP stack did not correctly handle certain
  unreachable messages. If a remote attacker were able to acquire a socket
  lock, they could send specially  ...
