tag_insight = "The Cluster Manager (cman) utility provides services for managing a Linux
  cluster.

  Multiple insecure temporary file use flaws were found in fence_apc_snmp and
  ccs_tool. A local attacker could use these flaws to overwrite an arbitrary
  file writable by a victim running those utilities (typically root) with
  the output of the utilities via a symbolic link attack. (CVE-2008-4579,
  CVE-2008-6552)
  
  Bug fixes:
  
  * a buffer could overflow if cluster.conf had more than 52 entries per
  block inside the &lt;cman&gt; block. The limit is now 1024.
  
  * the output of the group_tool dump subcommands were NULL padded.
  
  * using device=&quot;&quot; instead of label=&quot;&quot; no longer causes qdiskd to
  incorrectly exit.
  
  * the IPMI fencing agent has been modified to time out after 10 seconds. It
  is also now possible to specify a different timeout value with the '-t'
  option.
  
  * the IPMI fencing agent now allows punctuation in passwords.
  
  * quickly starting and stopping the cman service no longer causes the
  cluster membership to become inconsistent across the cluster.
  
  * an issue with lock syncing caused 'receive_own from' errors to be logged
  to '/var/log/messages'.
  
  * an issue which caused gfs_controld to segfault when mounting hundreds of
  file systems has been fixed.
  
  * the LPAR fencing agent now properly reports status when an LPAR is in
  Open Firmware mode.
  
  * the LPAR fencing agent now works properly with systems using the
  Integrated Virtualization Manager (IVM).
  
  * the APC SNMP fencing agent now properly recognizes outletStatusOn and
  outletStatusOff return codes from the SNMP agent.
  
  * the WTI fencing agent can now connect to fencing devices with no
  password.
  
  * the rps-10 fencing agent now properly performs a reboot when run with no
  options.
  
  * the IPMI fencing agent now supports different cipher types with the '-C'
  option.
  
  * qdisk now properly scans devices and partitions.
  
  * cman now checks to see if a new node has state to prevent killing the
  first node during cluster setup.
  
  * 'service qdiskd start' now works properly.
  
  * the McData fence agent now works properly with the McData Sphereon 4500
  Fabric Switch.
  
  * the Egenera fence agent can now specify an SSH login name.
  
  * the APC fence agent now works with non-admin accounts when using the
  3.5.x firmware.
  
  * fence_xvmd now tries two methods to reboot a virtual machine.
  
  * connections to OpenAIS are now allowed from unprivileged CPG clients with
  the user and group of 'ais'.
  
  * groupd no longer allows the default fence d ...
