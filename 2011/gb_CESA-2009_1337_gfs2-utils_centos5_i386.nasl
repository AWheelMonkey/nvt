tag_insight = "The gfs2-utils package provides the user-space tools necessary to mount,
  create, maintain, and test GFS2 file systems.

  Multiple insecure temporary file use flaws were discovered in GFS2 user
  level utilities. A local attacker could use these flaws to overwrite an
  arbitrary file writable by a victim running those utilities (typically
  root) with the output of the utilities via a symbolic link attack.
  (CVE-2008-6552)
  
  This update also fixes the following bugs:
  
  * gfs2_fsck now properly detects and repairs problems with sequence numbers
  on GFS2 file systems.
  
  * GFS2 user utilities now use the file system UUID.
  
  * gfs2_grow now properly updates the file system size during operation.
  
  * gfs2_fsck now returns the proper exit codes.
  
  * gfs2_convert now properly frees blocks when removing free blocks up to
  height 2.
  
  * the gfs2_fsck manual page has been renamed to fsck.gfs2 to match current
  standards.
  
  * the 'gfs2_tool df' command now provides human-readable output.
  
  * mounting GFS2 file systems with the noatime or noquota option now works
  properly.
  
  * new capabilities have been added to the gfs2_edit tool to help in testing
  and debugging GFS and GFS2 issues.
  
  * the 'gfs2_tool df' command no longer segfaults on file systems with a
  block size other than 4k.
  
  * the gfs2_grow manual page no longer references the '-r' option, which has
  been removed.
  
  * the 'gfs2_tool unfreeze' command no longer hangs during use.
  
  * gfs2_convert no longer corrupts file systems when converting from GFS to
  GFS2.
  
  * gfs2_fsck no longer segfaults when encountering a block which is listed
  as both a data and stuffed directory inode.
  
  * gfs2_fsck can now fix file systems even if the journal is already locked
  for use.
  
  * a GFS2 file system's metadata is now properly copied with 'gfs2_edit
  savemeta' and 'gfs2_edit restoremeta'.
  
  * the gfs2_edit savemeta function now properly saves blocks of type 2.
  
  * 'gfs2_convert -vy' now works properly on the PowerPC architecture.
  
  * when mounting a GFS2 file system as '/', mount_gfs2 no longer fails after
  being unable to find the file system in '/proc/mounts'.
  
  * gfs2_fsck no longer segfaults when fixing 'EA leaf block type' problems.
  
  All gfs2-utils users should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves
  these issues.";
