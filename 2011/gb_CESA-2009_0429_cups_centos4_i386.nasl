tag_insight = "The Common UNIX® Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
  for UNIX operating systems.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the CUPS JBIG2 decoder. An
  attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause CUPS to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the &quot;lp&quot; user if the file was
  printed. (CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-1179)
  
  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the CUPS JBIG2 decoder. An
  attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause CUPS to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the &quot;lp&quot; user if the file was
  printed. (CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-1182)
  
  Multiple flaws were found in the CUPS JBIG2 decoder that could lead to the
  freeing of arbitrary memory. An attacker could create a malicious PDF file
  that would cause CUPS to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
  as the &quot;lp&quot; user if the file was printed. (CVE-2009-0166, CVE-2009-1180)
  
  Multiple input validation flaws were found in the CUPS JBIG2 decoder. An
  attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause CUPS to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the &quot;lp&quot; user if the file was
  printed. (CVE-2009-0800)
  
  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  discovered in the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) decoding routines used by
  the CUPS image-converting filters, &quot;imagetops&quot; and &quot;imagetoraster&quot;. An
  attacker could create a malicious TIFF file that could, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code as the &quot;lp&quot; user if the file was printed.
  (CVE-2009-0163)
  
  Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the CUPS JBIG2 decoder. An
  attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause CUPS to crash
  when printed. (CVE-2009-0799, CVE-2009-1181, CVE-2009-1183)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank Aaron Sigel, Braden Thomas and Drew Yao of
  the Apple Product Security team, and Will Dormann of the CERT/CC for
  responsibly reporting these flaws.
