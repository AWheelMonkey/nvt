tag_insight = "Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Iceape internet suite,
an unbranded version of Seamonkey:

CVE-2011-2372

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that websites could open a download
dialog - which has open as the default action -, while a user
presses the ENTER key.

CVE-2011-2995

Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary and Jesse Ruderman discovered crashes
in the rendering engine, which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2998

Mark Kaplan discovered an integer underflow in the javascript
engine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2999

Boris Zbarsky discovered that incorrect handling of the
window.location object could lead to bypasses of the same-origin
policy.

CVE-2011-3000

Ian Graham discovered that multiple Location headers might lead to
CRLF injection.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package
only provides the XPCOM code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-8. This update also marks the compromised DigiNotar
root certs as revoked rather then untrusted.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.";
