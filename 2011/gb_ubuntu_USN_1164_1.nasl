  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Thomas Pollet discovered that the RDS network protocol did not check
  certain iovec buffers. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the
  system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user. (CVE-2010-3865)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the CAN protocol on 64bit systems did not
  correctly calculate the size of certain buffers. A local attacker could
  exploit this to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the
  root user. (CVE-2010-3874)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Linux kernel X.25 implementation did
  not correctly clear kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this to
  read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3875)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Linux kernel sockets implementation did
  not properly initialize certain structures. A local attacker could exploit
  this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
  (CVE-2010-3876)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the TIPC interface did not correctly
  initialize certain structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read
  kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3877)

  Nelson Elhage discovered that the Linux kernel IPv4 implementation did not
  properly audit certain bytecodes in netlink messages. A local attacker
  could exploit this to cause the kernel to hang, leading to a denial of
  service. (CVE-2010-3880)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the RME Hammerfall DSP audio interface driver
  did not correctly clear kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this
  to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-4080,
  CVE-2010-4081)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the VIA video driver did not correctly clear
  kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack
  memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-4082)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the semctl syscall did not correctly clear
  kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack
  memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-4083)

  James Bottomley discovered that the ICP vortex storage array controller
  driver did not validate certain sizes. A local attacker on a 64bit system
  could exploit this to crash the kernel, leading to a denial of service.
  (CVE-2010-4157)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered multiple flaws in the X.25 facilities parsing. If
  a system was using X.25, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the
  system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4164)

  It was discovered that multithreaded exec did not handle CPU timers
