  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the password change page of
  the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT). If a remote attacker could trick
  a user, who was logged into the SWAT interface, into visiting a
  specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in
  the context of the user's SWAT session. (CVE-2011-2694)

  It was found that SWAT web pages did not protect against Cross-Site
  Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker could trick a user,
  who was logged into the SWAT interface, into visiting a specially-crafted
  URL, the attacker could perform Samba configuration changes with the
  privileges of the logged in user. (CVE-2011-2522)

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2010-0547, provided by the Samba rebase
  in RHBA-2011:0054, was incomplete. The mount.cifs tool did not properly
  handle share or directory names containing a newline character, allowing a
  local attacker to corrupt the mtab (mounted file systems table) file via a
  specially-crafted CIFS (Common Internet File System) share mount request,
  if mount.cifs had the setuid bit set. (CVE-2011-2724)

  It was found that the mount.cifs tool did not handle certain errors
  correctly when updating the mtab file. If mount.cifs had the setuid bit
  set, a local attacker could corrupt the mtab file by setting a small file
  size limit before running mount.cifs. (CVE-2011-1678)

  Note: mount.cifs from the samba3x packages distributed by Red Hat does not
  have the setuid bit set. We recommend that administrators do not manually
  set the setuid bit for mount.cifs.

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting CVE-2011-2694
  and CVE-2011-2522, and Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2011-1678. Upstream
  acknowledges Nobuhiro Tsuji of NTT DATA Security Corporation as the
  original reporter of CVE-2011-2694, and Yoshihiro Ishikawa of LAC Co., Ltd.
  as the original reporter of CVE-2011-2522.

  Users of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.");
