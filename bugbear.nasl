# Well, in fact I started from a simple script by Thomas Reinke and
# heavily hacked every byte of it :-]

# There was no information on the BugBear protocol.
# I found a worm in the wild and found that it replied to the "p" command;
# the data look random but ends with "ID:"  and a number
# Thomas Reinke confirmed that his specimen of the worm behaved in the
# same way.
# We will not provide the full data here because it might contain
