  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Server. PHP's fileinfo module provides functions used to identify a
particular file according to the type of data contained by the file.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the File Information (fileinfo)
extension processed certain Pascal strings. A remote attacker able to make
a PHP application using fileinfo convert a specially crafted Pascal string
provided by an image file could cause that application to crash.
(CVE-2014-3478)

Multiple flaws were found in the File Information (fileinfo) extension
regular expression rules for detecting various files. A remote attacker
could use either of these flaws to cause a PHP application using fileinfo
to consume an excessive amount of CPU. (CVE-2014-3538)

It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-1571 was incomplete  the File
Information (fileinfo) extension did not correctly parse certain Composite
Document Format (CDF) files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash
a PHP application using fileinfo via a specially crafted CDF file.
(CVE-2014-3587)

It was found that PHP's gd extension did not properly handle file names
with a null character. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
make a PHP application access unexpected files and bypass intended file
system access restrictions. (CVE-2014-5120)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the gdImageCreateFromXpm()
function of PHP's gd extension. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
crash a PHP application using gd via a specially crafted X PixMap (XPM)
file. (CVE-2014-2497)

Multiple buffer over-read flaws were found in the php_parserr() function of
PHP. A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly
use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as the PHP interpreter if a PHP
application used the dns_get_record() function to perform a DNS query.
(CVE-2014-3597)

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the way PHP handled certain Standard
PHP Library (SPL) Iterators and ArrayIterators. A malicious script author
could possibly use either of these flaws to disclose certain portions of
server memory. (CVE-2014-4670, CVE-2014-4698)

The CVE-2014-3478 issue was discovered by Francisco Alonso of Red Hat
Product Security, the CVE-2014-3538 issue was discovered by Jan Kalua of
the Red Hat Web Stack Team, and the CVE-2014-3597 issue was discovered by
David Kutlek of the Red Hat BaseOS QE.
