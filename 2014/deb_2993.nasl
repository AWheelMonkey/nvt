For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution

For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in
version 0.2.5.6-alpha-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.";

low-latency anonymous communication system, resulting in information

Relay-early cells could be used by colluding relays on the network to
tag user circuits and so deploy traffic confirmation attacks
[CVE-2014-5117 
]. The updated version emits a warning and drops the
circuit upon receiving inbound relay-early cells, preventing this
specific kind of attack. Please consult the following advisory for
more details about this issue:

https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack 
A bug in the bounds-checking in the 32-bit curve25519-donna
implementation could cause incorrect results on 32-bit
implementations when certain malformed inputs were used along with a
small class of private ntor keys. This flaw does not currently
appear to allow an attacker to learn private keys or impersonate a
Tor server, but it could provide a means to distinguish 32-bit Tor
implementations from 64-bit Tor implementations.

The following additional security-related improvements have been
implemented:

As a client, the new version will effectively stop using CREATE_FAST
cells. While this adds computational load on the network, this
approach can improve security on connections where Tor's circuit
handshake is stronger than the available TLS connection security
levels.

Prepare clients to use fewer entry guards by honoring the consensus
parameters. The following article provides some background:
