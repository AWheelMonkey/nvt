Ruderman, Dan Gohman, Christoph Diehl, Gregor Wagner, Gary Kwong, Luke Wagner,
Rob Fletcher and Makoto Kato discovered multiple memory safety issues in
Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,
an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service
via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2014-1493, CVE-2014-1494)

Atte Kettunen discovered an out-of-bounds read during WAV file decoding.
An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service
via application crash. (CVE-2014-1497)

David Keeler discovered that crypto.generateCRFMRequest did not correctly
validate all arguments. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
cause a denial of service via application crash. (CVE-2014-1498)

Ehsan Akhgari discovered that the WebRTC permission dialog can display
the wrong originating site information under some circumstances. An
attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking a user in order to
gain access to their webcam or microphone. (CVE-2014-1499)

Tim Philipp Sch&#228 fers and Sebastian Neef discovered that onbeforeunload
events used with page navigations could make the browser unresponsive
in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-1500)

Jeff Gilbert discovered that WebGL content could manipulate content from
another sites WebGL context. An attacker could potentially exploit this
to conduct spoofing attacks. (CVE-2014-1502)

Nicolas Golubovic discovered that CSP could be bypassed for data:
documents during session restore. An attacker could potentially exploit
this to conduct cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2014-1504)

Robert O'Callahan discovered a mechanism for timing attacks involving
SVG filters and displacements input to feDisplacementMap. An attacker
could potentially exploit this to steal confidential information across
domains. (CVE-2014-1505)

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered an out-of-bounds read
during polygon rendering in MathML. An attacker could potentially exploit
this to steal confidential information across domains. (CVE-2014-1508)

John Thomson discovered a memory corruption bug in the Cairo graphics
library. If a user had a malicious extension installed, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2014-1509)
