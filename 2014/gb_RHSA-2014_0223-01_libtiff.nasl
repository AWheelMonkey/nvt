Image File Format (TIFF) files.

A heap-based buffer overflow and a use-after-free flaw were found in the
tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially
crafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2013-1960, CVE-2013-4232)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the gif2tiff tool. An attacker
could use these flaws to create a specially crafted GIF file that could
cause gif2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2013-4231, CVE-2013-4243, CVE-2013-4244)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker
could use these flaws to create a specially crafted TIFF file that would
cause tiff2pdf to crash. (CVE-2013-1961)

Red Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon of NCI Agency for reporting
CVE-2013-1960 and CVE-2013-1961. The CVE-2013-4243 issue was discovered by
Murray McAllister of the Red Hat Security Response Team, and the
CVE-2013-4244 issue was discovered by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat
Security Response Team.
