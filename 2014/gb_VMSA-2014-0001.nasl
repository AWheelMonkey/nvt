  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"a. VMware ESXi and ESX NFC NULL pointer dereference

VMware ESXi and ESX contain a NULL pointer dereference in the handling
of the Network File Copy (NFC) traffic. To exploit this vulnerability,
an attacker must intercept and modify the NFC traffic between
ESXi/ESX and the client. Exploitation of the issue may lead to a
Denial of Service.

To reduce the likelihood of exploitation, vSphere components should be
deployed on an isolated management network.

b. VMware VMX process denial of service vulnerability

Due to a flaw in the handling of invalid ports, it is possible to
cause the VMX process to fail. This vulnerability may allow a guest
user to affect the VMX process resulting in a partial denial of
service on the host.

c. VMware vCloud Director Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

VMware vCloud Director contains a vulnerability in the Hyper Text
Transfer Protocol (http) session management. An attacker may trick
an authenticated user to click a malicious link, which would result
in the user being logged out. The user is able to immediately log
back into the system. ");
