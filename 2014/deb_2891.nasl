version 1:1.19.14+dfsg-0+deb7u1 of the mediawiki package and 3.5~deb7u1
of the mediawiki-extensions package.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.19.14+dfsg-1 of the mediawiki package and 3.5 of the
mediawiki-extensions package.

We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.";
tag_summary   = "Several vulnerabilities were discovered in MediaWiki, a wiki engine.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
issues:

CVE-2013-2031 
Cross-site scripting attack via valid UTF-7 encoded sequences
in a SVG file.

CVE-2013-4567 & CVE-2013-4568 
Kevin Israel (Wikipedia user PleaseStand) reported two ways
to inject Javascript due to an incomplete blacklist in the
CSS sanitizer function.

CVE-2013-4572 
MediaWiki and the CentralNotice extension were incorrectly setting
cache headers when a user was autocreated, causing the user's
session cookies to be cached, and returned to other users.

CVE-2013-6452 
Chris from RationalWiki reported that SVG files could be
uploaded that include external stylesheets, which could lead to
XSS when an XSL was used to include JavaScript.

CVE-2013-6453 
MediaWiki's SVG sanitization could be bypassed when the XML was
considered invalid.

CVE-2013-6454 
MediaWiki's CSS sanitization did not filter -o-link attributes,
which could be used to execute JavaScript in Opera 12.

CVE-2013-6472 
MediaWiki displayed some information about deleted pages in
the log API, enhanced RecentChanges, and user watchlists.

CVE-2014-1610 
A remote code execution vulnerability existed if file upload
support for DjVu (natively handled) or PDF files (in
combination with the PdfHandler extension) was enabled.
Neither file type is enabled by default in MediaWiki.

CVE-2014-2665 
Cross site request forgery in login form: an attacker could login
a victim as the attacker.";
