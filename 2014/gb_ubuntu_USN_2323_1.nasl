properly perform input sanitization on Heat templates. If a user were tricked
into using a specially crafted Heat template, an attacker could conduct
cross-site scripting attacks. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a
user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a
remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal
confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2014-3473)

Craig Lorentzen discovered that OpenStack Horizon did not properly perform
input sanitization when creating networks. If a user were tricked into
launching an image using the crafted network name, an attacker could
conduct cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2014-3474)

Michael Xin discovered that OpenStack Horizon did not properly perform
input sanitization when adding users. If an admin user were tricked into
viewing the users page containing a crafted email address, an attacker
could conduct cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2014-3475)

Dennis Felsch and Mario Heiderich discovered that OpenStack Horizon did not
properly perform input sanitization when creating host aggregates. If an
admin user were tricked into viewing the Host Aggregates page containing a
crafted availability zone name, an attacker could conduct cross-site
scripting attacks. (CVE-2014-3594)");
