A use-after-free was discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed
render process. (CVE-2014-3169)

A use-after-free was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-3171)

It was discovered that WebGL clear calls did not interact properly with
the state of a draw buffer. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3173)

A threading issue was discovered in the Web Audio API during attempts to
update biquad filter coefficients. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3174)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
