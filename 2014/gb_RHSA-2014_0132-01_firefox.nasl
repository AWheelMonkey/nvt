Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2014-1477, CVE-2014-1482, CVE-2014-1486)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled error messages related to web
workers. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the same-origin policy,
which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or could
potentially be used to gather authentication tokens and other data from
third-party websites. (CVE-2014-1487)

A flaw was found in the implementation of System Only Wrappers (SOW).
An attacker could use this flaw to crash Firefox. When combined with other
vulnerabilities, this flaw could have additional security implications.
(CVE-2014-1479)

It was found that the Firefox JavaScript engine incorrectly handled window
objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass certain security
checks and possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-1481)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 24.3.0 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.
