Ruderman, Dan Gohman and Christoph Diehl discovered multiple memory safety
issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit
these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
(CVE-2014-1493)

Atte Kettunen discovered an out-of-bounds read during WAV file decoding.
If a user had enabled audio, an attacker could potentially exploit this
to cause a denial of service via application crash. (CVE-2014-1497)

Robert O'Callahan discovered a mechanism for timing attacks involving
SVG filters and displacements input to feDisplacementMap. If a user had
enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal
confidential information across domains. (CVE-2014-1505)

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered an out-of-bounds read
during polygon rendering in MathML. If a user had enabled scripting, an
attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential information
across domains. (CVE-2014-1508)

John Thomson discovered a memory corruption bug in the Cairo graphics
library. If a user had a malicious extension installed, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1509)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that web content could open a chrome privileged
page and bypass the popup blocker in some circumstances. If a user had
enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
(CVE-2014-1510, CVE-2014-1511)

It was discovered that memory pressure during garbage collection resulted
in memory corruption in some circumstances. If a user had enabled
scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial
of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1512)

J&#252 ri Aedla discovered out-of-bounds reads and writes with TypedArrayObject
in some circumstances. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1513)

George Hotz discovered an out-of-bounds write with TypedArrayObject. If a
user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1514)");
