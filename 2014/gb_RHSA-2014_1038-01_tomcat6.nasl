Pages (JSP) technologies.

It was found that several application-provided XML files, such as web.xml,
content.xml, *.tld, *.tagx, and *.jspx, resolved external entities,
permitting XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. An attacker able to deploy
malicious applications to Tomcat could use this flaw to circumvent security
restrictions set by the JSM, and gain access to sensitive information on
the system. Note that this flaw only affected deployments in which Tomcat
is running applications from untrusted sources, such as in a shared hosting
environment. (CVE-2013-4590)

It was found that, in certain circumstances, it was possible for a
malicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by Apache Tomcat
to process XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library
descriptors (TLDs), and tag plug-in configuration files. The injected XML
parser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities
and/or gain access to the XML files processed for other web applications
deployed on the same Apache Tomcat instance. (CVE-2014-0119)
