A race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found in
the mod_status httpd module. A remote attacker able to access a status page
served by mod_status on a server using a threaded Multi-Processing Module
(MPM) could send a specially crafted request that would cause the httpd
child process to crash or, possibly, allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the 'apache' user. (CVE-2014-0226)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the mod_cache httpd module.
A malicious HTTP server could cause the httpd child process to crash when
the Apache HTTP Server was used as a forward proxy with caching.
(CVE-2013-4352)

A denial of service flaw was found in the mod_proxy httpd module. A remote
attacker could send a specially crafted request to a server configured as a
reverse proxy using a threaded Multi-Processing Modules (MPM) that would
cause the httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2014-0117)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_deflate module
handled request body decompression (configured via the 'DEFLATE' input
filter). A remote attacker able to send a request whose body would be
decompressed could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of system
memory and CPU on the target system. (CVE-2014-0118)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_cgid module
executed CGI scripts that did not read data from the standard input.
A remote attacker could submit a specially crafted request that would cause
the httpd child process to hang indefinitely. (CVE-2014-0231)

contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
