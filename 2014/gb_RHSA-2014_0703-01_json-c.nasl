  script_tag(name:"affected", value:"json-c on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server (v. 7)");
  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"JSON-C implements a reference counting object model that allows you to
easily construct JSON objects in C, output them as JSON-formatted strings,
and parse JSON-formatted strings back into the C representation of
JSON objects.

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the way the json-c library
handled long strings in JSON documents. An attacker able to make an
application using json-c parse excessively large JSON input could cause the
application to crash. (CVE-2013-6370)

A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of hash arrays in
json-c. An attacker could use this flaw to make an application using json-c
consume an excessive amount of CPU time by providing a specially crafted
JSON document that triggers multiple hash function collisions. To mitigate
this issue, json-c now uses a different hash function and randomization to
reduce the chance of an attacker successfully causing intentional
collisions. (CVE-2013-6371)

These issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product
Security Team.

All json-c users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.");
