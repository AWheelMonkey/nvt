Badea discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2014-1547, CVE-2014-1548)

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow when interacting with WebAudio
buffers. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2014-1549)

Atte Kettunen discovered a use-after-free in WebAudio. An attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2014-1550)

event is triggered in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2014-1555)

Patrick Cozzi discovered a crash when using the Cesium JS library to
generate WebGL content. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
execute arbitrary code with the privilges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2014-1556)

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a use-after-free in
CERT_DestroyCertificate. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2014-1544)

A crash was discovered in Skia when scaling an image, if the scaling
operation takes too long. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2014-1557)

Christian Holler discovered several issues when parsing certificates
with non-standard character encoding, resulting in the inability to
