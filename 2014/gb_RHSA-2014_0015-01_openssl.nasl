  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL determined which hashing algorithm to
use when TLS protocol version 1.2 was enabled. This could possibly cause
OpenSSL to use an incorrect hashing algorithm, leading to a crash of an
application using the library. (CVE-2013-6449)

It was discovered that the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
protocol implementation in OpenSSL did not properly maintain encryption and
digest contexts during renegotiation. A lost or discarded renegotiation
handshake packet could cause a DTLS client or server using OpenSSL to
crash. (CVE-2013-6450)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled
TLS/SSL protocol handshake packets. A specially crafted handshake packet
could cause a TLS/SSL client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2013-4353)

All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take
effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or
the system rebooted.");
