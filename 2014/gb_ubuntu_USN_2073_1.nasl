Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-
buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could
exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2013-4511)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo
Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to
cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. (CVE-2013-4513)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's
driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the
CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2013-4514)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data
stored on the device. (CVE-2013-6383)

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.
A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) or possibly gain privileges. (CVE-2013-6763)

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header
