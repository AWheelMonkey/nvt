For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.";
tag_summary   = "Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-0480 
Florian Apolloner discovered that in certain situations, URL
reversing could generate scheme-relative URLs which could
unexpectedly redirect a user to a different host, leading to
phishing attacks.

CVE-2014-0481 
David Wilson reported a file upload denial of service vulnerability.
Django's file upload handling in its default configuration may
degrade to producing a huge number of `os.stat()` system calls when
a duplicate filename is uploaded. A remote attacker with the ability
to upload files can cause poor performance in the upload handler,
eventually causing it to become very slow.

CVE-2014-0482 
David Greisen discovered that under some circumstances, the use of
the RemoteUserMiddleware middleware and the RemoteUserBackend
authentication backend could result in one user receiving another
user's session, if a change to the REMOTE_USER header occurred
without corresponding logout/login actions.

CVE-2014-0483Collin Anderson discovered that it is possible to reveal any field's
data by modifying the popup and to_field 
parameters of the query
string on an admin change form page. A user with access to the admin
interface, and with sufficient knowledge of model structure and the
appropriate URLs, could construct popup views which would display
the values of non-relationship fields, including fields the
application developer had not intended to expose in such a fashion.";
tag_vuldetect = "This check tests the installed software version using the apt package manager.";
