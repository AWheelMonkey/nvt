  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for openvpn fixes the following issues:

  - Some parts of the certificate-parsing code did not always clear all
  allocated memory. This would have allowed clients to leak a few bytes of
  memory for each connection attempt, thereby facilitating a (quite
  inefficient) DoS attack on the server. [bsc#1044947, CVE-2017-7521]

  - The ASN1 parsing code contained a bug that could have resulted in some
  buffers being free()d twice, and this issue could have potentially been
  triggered remotely by a VPN peer. [bsc#1044947, CVE-2017-7521]

  - If clients used a HTTP proxy with NTLM authentication, a
  man-in-the-middle attacker between client and proxy could cause the
  client to crash or disclose at most 96 bytes of stack memory. The
  disclosed stack memory was likely to contain the proxy password. If the
  proxy password had not been reused, this was unlikely to compromise the
  security of the OpenVPN tunnel itself. Clients who did not use the

  - -http-proxy option with ntlm2 authentication were not affected.
  [bsc#1044947, CVE-2017-7520]

  - It was possible to trigger an assertion by sending a malformed IPv6
  packet. That issue could have been abused to remotely shutdown an
  openvpn server or client, if IPv6 and --mssfix were enabled and if the
  IPv6 networks used inside the VPN were known. [bsc#1044947,
  CVE-2017-7508]
