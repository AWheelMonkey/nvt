  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Git is a distributed revision control system
  with a decentralized architecture. As opposed to centralized version control
  systems with a client-server model, Git ensures that each working copy of a Git
  repository is an exact copy with complete revision history. This not only allows
  the user to work on and contribute to projects without the need to have
  permission to push the changes to their official repositories, but also makes it
  possible for the user to work with no network connection. Security Fix(es): * It
  was found that the git-prompt.sh script shipped with git failed to correctly
  handle branch names containing special characters. A specially crafted git
  repository could use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands if a user working
  with the repository configured their shell to include repository information in
  the prompt. (CVE-2014-9938) * A flaw was found in the way git-shell handled
  command-line options for the restricted set of git-shell commands. A remote,
  authenticated attacker could use this flaw to bypass git-shell restrictions, to
  view and manipulate files, by abusing the instance of the less command launched
  using crafted command-line options. (CVE-2017-8386) Additional Changes: For
  detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 7.4 Release Notes linked from the References section.");
