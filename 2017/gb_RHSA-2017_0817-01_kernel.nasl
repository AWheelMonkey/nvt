Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that a remote attacker could leverage the generation of
IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary
IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not
needed) and could subsequently perform any type of a fragmentation-based
attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement RFC6946.
(CVE-2016-10142, Moderate)

  * A flaw was discovered in the way the Linux kernel dealt with paging
structures. When the kernel invalidated a paging structure that was not in
use locally, it could, in principle, race against another CPU that is
switching to a process that uses the paging structure in question. A local
user could use a thread running with a stale cached virtual- physical
translation to potentially escalate their privileges if the translation in
question were writable and the physical page got reused for something
critical (for example, a page table). (CVE-2016-2069, Moderate)

  * A race condition flaw was found in the ioctl_send_fib() function in the
Linux kernel's aacraid implementation. A local attacker could use this flaw
to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access or system crash) by
changing a certain size value. (CVE-2016-6480, Moderate)

  * It was found that when the gcc stack protector was enabled, reading the
/proc/keys file could cause a panic in the Linux kernel due to stack
corruption. This happened because an incorrect buffer size was used to hold
a 64-bit timeout value rendered as weeks. (CVE-2016-7042, Moderate)

  * It was found that when file permissions were modified via chmod and the
user modifying them was not in the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID,
the setgid bit would be cleared. Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr sets the
file permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit
in a similar way. This could allow a local user to gain group privileges
via certain setgid applications. (CVE-2016-7097, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the Linux networking subsystem where a local attacker
with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds memory access
by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and sending to its
destination via sendto(). (CVE-2016-8399, Moderate)

  * It was found that the blk_rq_map_user_iov() function in the Linux
kernel's block device implementation did not properly restrict the type of
iterator, which could allow a local attacker to re ...
