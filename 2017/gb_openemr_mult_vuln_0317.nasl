1. OS Command Injection
  Any OS commands can be injected by an authenticated attacker with any role.
  This is a serious vulnerability as the chance for the system to be fully compromised is very high.

2. Reflected Cross Site Scripting
  This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious client side
scripting which will be executed in the browser of users if they visit the
manipulated site. There are different issues affecting various components.");
