  (LDAPv3) compliant server. The base packages include the Lightweight Directory
  Access Protocol (LDAP) server and command-line utilities for server
  administration.

Security Fix(es):

* An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in the way 389-ds-base
handled LDAP bind requests. A remote unauthenticated attacker could use
this flaw to make ns-slapd crash via a specially crafted LDAP bind request,
resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2017-2668)

Red Hat would like to thank Joachim Jabs (F24) for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, when adding a filtered role definition that uses the 'nsrole'
virtual attribute in the filter, Directory Server terminated unexpectedly.
A patch has been applied, and now the roles plug-in ignores all virtual
attributes. As a result, an error message is logged when an invalid filter
is used. Additionally, the role is deactivated and Directory Server no
longer fails. (BZ#1429498)

* In a replication topology, Directory Server incorrectly calculated the
size of string format entries when a lot of entries were deleted. The
calculated size of entries was smaller than the actual required size.
Consequently, Directory Server allocated insufficient memory and terminated
unexpectedly when the data was written to it. With this update, the size of
string format entries is now calculated correctly in the described
situation and Directory Server no longer terminates unexpectedly.
(BZ#1429495)
