Andrew Krasichkov discovered that event handlers on  marquee  elements
were executed despite a Content Security Policy (CSP) that disallowed
inline JavaScript. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
(CVE-2016-9895)

A memory corruption issue was discovered in WebGL in some circumstances.
If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a
browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2016-9897)

A use-after-free was discovered when manipulating DOM subtrees in the
Editor. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website
in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary

in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2016-9899)

It was discovered that external resources that should be blocked when
loading SVG images can bypass security restrictions using data: URLs. An
attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information.
(CVE-2016-9900)

Jann Horn discovered that JavaScript Map/Set were vulnerable to timing
attacks. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website
in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
obtain sensitive information across domains. (CVE-2016-9904)

A crash was discovered in EnumerateSubDocuments while adding or removing
sub-documents. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this
to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-9905)

JIT code allocation can allow a bypass of ASLR protections in some
