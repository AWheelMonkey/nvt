  script_tag(name:"summary",  value:"Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Irssi, a terminal based
IRC client. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2017-10965Brian geeknik 
Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that Irssi does
not properly handle receiving messages with invalid time stamps. A
malicious IRC server can take advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi
to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2017-10966Brian geeknik 
Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that Irssi is
susceptible to a use-after-free flaw triggered while updating the
internal nick list. A malicious IRC server can take advantage of
this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2017-15227 
Joseph Bisch discovered that while waiting for the channel
synchronisation, Irssi may incorrectly fail to remove destroyed
channels from the query list, resulting in use after free conditions
when updating the state later on. A malicious IRC server can take
advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a
denial of service.

CVE-2017-15228 
Hanno Boeck reported that Irssi does not properly handle installing
themes with unterminated colour formatting sequences, leading to a
denial of service if a user is tricked into installing a specially
crafted theme.

CVE-2017-15721 
Joseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly handle
incorrectly formatted DCC CTCP messages. A remote attacker can take
advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a
denial of service.

CVE-2017-15722 
Joseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly verify Safe
channel IDs. A malicious IRC server can take advantage of this flaw
to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2017-15723 
Joseph Bisch reported that Irssi does not properly handle overlong
nicks or targets resulting in a NULL pointer dereference when
splitting the message and leading to a denial of service.");
