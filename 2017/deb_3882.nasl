and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2016-6127 
It was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to a cross-site
scripting (XSS) attack if an attacker uploads a malicious file with
a certain content type. Installations which use the
AlwaysDownloadAttachments config setting are unaffected by this
flaw. The applied fix addresses all existant and future uploaded
attachments.

CVE-2017-5361 
It was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to timing
side-channel attacks for user passwords.

CVE-2017-5943 
It was discovered that Request Tracker is prone to an information
leak of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) verification tokens if a
user is tricked into visiting a specially crafted URL by an
attacker.

CVE-2017-5944 
It was discovered that Request Tracker is prone to a remote code
execution vulnerability in the dashboard subscription interface. A
privileged attacker can take advantage of this flaw through
carefully-crafted saved search names to cause unexpected code to be
executed. The applied fix addresses all existant and future saved
searches.

Additionally to the above mentioned CVEs, this update workarounds
CVE-2015-7686 

in Email::Address which could induce a denial of service
of Request Tracker itself.");
