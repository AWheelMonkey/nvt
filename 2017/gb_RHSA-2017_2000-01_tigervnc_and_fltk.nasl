  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote
  display system which allows users to view a computing desktop environment not
  only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and
  from a wide variety of machine architectures. TigerVNC is a suite of VNC servers
  and clients which allows users to connect to other desktops running a VNC
  server. FLTK (pronounced 'fulltick') is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit. It
  provides modern GUI functionality without the bloat, and supports 3D graphics
  via OpenGL and its built-in GLUT emulation. The following packages have been
  upgraded to a later upstream version: tigervnc (1.8.0), fltk (1.3.4).
  (BZ#1388620, BZ#1413598) Security Fix(es): * A denial of service flaw was found
  in the TigerVNC's Xvnc server. A remote unauthenticated attacker could use this
  flaw to make Xvnc crash by terminating the TLS handshake process early.
  (CVE-2016-10207) * A double free flaw was found in the way TigerVNC handled
  ClientFence messages. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to
  make Xvnc crash by sending specially crafted ClientFence messages, resulting in
  denial of service. (CVE-2017-7393) * A missing input sanitization flaw was found
  in the way TigerVNC handled credentials. A remote unauthenticated attacker could
  use this flaw to make Xvnc crash by sending specially crafted usernames,
  resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2017-7394) * An integer overflow flaw was
  found in the way TigerVNC handled ClientCutText messages. A remote,
  authenticated attacker could use this flaw to make Xvnc crash by sending
  specially crafted ClientCutText messages, resulting in denial of service.
  (CVE-2017-7395) * A buffer overflow flaw, leading to memory corruption, was
  found in TigerVNC viewer. A remote malicious VNC server could use this flaw to
  crash the client vncviewer process resulting in denial of service.
  (CVE-2017-5581) * A memory leak flaw was found in the way TigerVNC handled
  termination of VeNCrypt connections. A remote unauthenticated attacker could
  repeatedly send connection requests to the Xvnc server, causing it to consume
  large amounts of memory resources over time, and ultimately leading to a denial
  of service due to memory exhaustion. (CVE-2017-7392) * A memory leak flaw was
  found in the way TigerVNC handled client connections. A remote unauthenticated
  attacker could repeatedly send connection requests to the Xvnc server, causing
  it to consume large amounts of memory resources over time, and ultimately
  leading to a denial of service due to memory exhaustion. (CVE-2017-7396)
