for controlling process state, does not perform validation on requested
XML-RPC methods, allowing an authenticated client to send a malicious
XML-RPC request to supervisord that will run arbitrary shell commands on
the server as the same user as supervisord.

The vulnerability has been fixed by disabling nested namespace lookup
entirely. supervisord will now only call methods on the object
registered to handle XML-RPC requests and not any child objects it may
contain, possibly breaking existing setups. No publicly available
plugins are currently known that use nested namespaces. Plugins that use
a single namespace will continue to work as before. Details can be found
on the upstream issue at
https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964
