also known as integrated branch clients (IBC), allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to change the startup-config file and force a reload of the
device, load a new IOS image on the device, and execute high-privilege CLI commands on switches running Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

Cisco does not consider this a vulnerability in Cisco IOS, IOS XE, or the Smart Install feature itself but a misuse of the Smart Install protocol, which
does not require authentication by design. Customers who are seeking more than zero-touch deployment should consider deploying the Cisco Network Plug and
Play solution instead.");

the Cisco Smart Install feature within customer infrastructures.");
