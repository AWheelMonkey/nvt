Security Fix(es):

* An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS server
handled certain attributes in request packets. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server or to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the FreeRADIUS server process by sending a specially crafted
request packet. (CVE-2017-10979)

* An out-of-bounds read and write flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS
server handled RADIUS packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted RADIUS packet.
(CVE-2017-10978)

* Multiple memory leak flaws were found in the way FreeRADIUS server
handled decoding of DHCP packets. A remote attacker could use these flaws
to cause the FreeRADIUS server to consume an increasing amount of memory
resources over time, possibly leading to a crash due to memory exhaustion,
by sending specially crafted DHCP packets. (CVE-2017-10980, CVE-2017-10981)

* Multiple out-of-bounds read flaws were found in the way FreeRADIUS server
handled decoding of DHCP packets. A remote attacker could use these flaws
to crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted DHCP request.
(CVE-2017-10982, CVE-2017-10983)

Red Hat would like to thank the FreeRADIUS project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Guido Vranken as the original reporter of
these issues.
