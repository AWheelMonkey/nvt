  Security Fix(es): * An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS 
  server handled certain attributes in request packets. A remote attacker could 
  use this flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server or to execute arbitrary code in the 
  context of the FreeRADIUS server process by sending a specially crafted request 
  packet. (CVE-2017-10984) * An out-of-bounds read and write flaw was found in the 
  way FreeRADIUS server handled RADIUS packets. A remote attacker could use this 
  flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted RADIUS 
  packet. (CVE-2017-10978) * An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way 
  FreeRADIUS server handled decoding of DHCP packets. A remote attacker could use 
  this flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted DHCP 
  request. (CVE-2017-10983) * A denial of service flaw was found in the way 
  FreeRADIUS server handled certain attributes in request packets. A remote 
  attacker could use this flaw to cause the FreeRADIUS server to enter an infinite 
  loop, consume increasing amounts of memory resources, and ultimately crash by 
  sending a specially crafted request packet. (CVE-2017-10985) * Multiple 
  out-of-bounds read flaws were found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled 
  decoding of DHCP packets. A remote attacker could use these flaws to crash the 
  FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted DHCP request. (CVE-2017-10986,
