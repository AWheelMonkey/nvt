  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used
to synchronize a computer's time with another referenced time source. These
packages include the ntpd service which continuously adjusts system time and
utilities used to query and configure the ntpd service.

Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that when ntp is configured with rate limiting for all
associations the limits are also applied to responses received from its
configured sources. A remote attacker who knows the sources can cause a
denial of service by preventing ntpd from accepting valid responses from
its sources. (CVE-2016-7426)

  * A flaw was found in the control mode functionality of ntpd. A remote
attacker could send a crafted control mode packet which could lead to
information disclosure or result in DDoS amplification attacks.
(CVE-2016-9310)

  * A flaw was found in the way ntpd implemented the trap service. A remote
attacker could send a specially crafted packet to cause a null pointer
dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a denial of service.
(CVE-2016-9311)

  * A flaw was found in the way ntpd running on a host with multiple network
interfaces handled certain server responses. A remote attacker could use
this flaw which would cause ntpd to not synchronize with the source.
(CVE-2016-7429)

  * A flaw was found in the way ntpd calculated the root delay. A remote
attacker could send a specially-crafted spoofed packet to cause denial of
service or in some special cases even crash. (CVE-2016-7433)");
