  script_tag(name: "insight", value: "OpenSSH is an SSH protocol implementation 
  supported by a number of Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems. It includes 
  the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and server. The following 
  packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openssh (7.4p1). 
  (BZ#1341754) Security Fix(es): * A covert timing channel flaw was found in the 
  way OpenSSH handled authentication of non-existent users. A remote 
  unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this flaw to determine valid user 
  names by measuring the timing of server responses. (CVE-2016-6210) * It was 
  found that OpenSSH did not limit password lengths for password authentication. A 
  remote unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to temporarily trigger high 
  CPU consumption in sshd by sending long passwords. (CVE-2016-6515) * It was 
  found that ssh-agent could load PKCS#11 modules from arbitrary paths. An 
  attacker having control of the forwarded agent-socket on the server, and the 
  ability to write to the filesystem of the client host, could use this flaw to 
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running ssh-agent. 
  (CVE-2016-10009) * It was found that the host private key material could 
  possibly leak to the privilege-separated child processes via re-allocated 
  memory. An attacker able to compromise the privilege-separated process could 
  therefore obtain the leaked key information. (CVE-2016-10011) * It was found 
  that the boundary checks in the code implementing support for pre-authentication 
  compression could have been optimized out by certain compilers. An attacker able 
  to compromise the privilege-separated process could possibly use this flaw for 
  further attacks against the privileged monitor process. (CVE-2016-10012) 
  Additional Changes: For detailed information on changes in this release, see the 
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Release Notes linked from the References section.
