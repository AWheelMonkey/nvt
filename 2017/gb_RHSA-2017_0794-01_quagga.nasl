  script_tag(name: "insight", value: "The quagga packages contain Quagga, the
free network-routing software suite that manages TCP/IP based protocols. Quagga
supports the BGP4, BGP4+, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, RIPv1, RIPv2, and RIPng protocols, and
is intended to be used as a Route Server and Route Reflector.

Security Fix(es):

* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Quagga handled
IPv6 router advertisement messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to crash the zebra daemon resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2016-1245)

* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Quagga BGP
routing daemon (bgpd) handled Labeled-VPN SAFI routes data. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to crash the bgpd daemon resulting in denial
of service. (CVE-2016-2342)

* A denial of service flaw was found in the Quagga BGP routing daemon
(bgpd). Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could send a crafted
packet to crash the bgpd daemon resulting in denial of service.
(CVE-2016-4049)

* A denial of service flaw affecting various daemons in Quagga was found. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the various Quagga daemons,
which expose their telnet interface, to crash. (CVE-2017-5495)

* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Quagga OSPFD
daemon handled LSA (link-state advertisement) packets. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to crash the ospfd daemon resulting in denial of
service. (CVE-2013-2236)
