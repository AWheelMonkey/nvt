  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"USN-3239-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the GNU
  C Library. Unfortunately, the fix for CVE-2015-5180 introduced an internal ABI
  change within the resolver library. This update reverts the change. We apologize
  for the inconvenience. Please note that long-running services that were
  restarted to compensate for the USN-3239-1 update may need to be restarted
  again. Original advisory details: It was discovered that the GNU C Library
  incorrectly handled the strxfrm() function. An attacker could use this issue to
  cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only
  affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-8982) It was
  discovered that an integer overflow existed in the _IO_wstr_overflow() function
  of the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or
  possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and
  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-8983) It was discovered that the fnmatch() function
  in the GNU C Library did not properly handle certain malformed patterns. An
  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected
  Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-8984) Alexander Cherepanov
  discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the glob implementation of the GNU C
  Library. An attacker could use this to specially craft a directory layout and
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-1234) Florian Weimer discovered a NULL
  pointer dereference in the DNS resolver of the GNU C Library. An attacker could
  use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-5180) Michael Petlan discovered
  an unbounded stack allocation in the getaddrinfo() function of the GNU C
  Library. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2016-3706) Aldy Hernandez discovered an unbounded stack allocation in the
  sunrpc implementation in the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this to cause
  a denial of service. (CVE-2016-4429) Tim Ruehsen discovered that the
  getaddrinfo() implementation in the GNU C Library did not properly track memory
  allocations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This issue
  only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-5417) Andreas Schwab discovered that
  the GNU C Library on ARM 32-bit platforms did not properly set up execution
  contexts. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.
