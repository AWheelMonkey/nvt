  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Pidgin is an instant messaging program which
  can log in to multiple accounts on multiple instant messaging networks
  simultaneously. The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream
  version: pidgin (2.10.11). (BZ#1369526) Security Fix(es): * A denial of service
  flaw was found in the way Pidgin's Mxit plug-in handled emoticons. A malicious
  remote server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could potentially use this flaw to
  crash Pidgin by sending a specially crafted emoticon. (CVE-2014-3695) * A denial
  of service flaw was found in the way Pidgin parsed Groupwise server messages. A
  malicious remote server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could potentially use
  this flaw to cause Pidgin to consume an excessive amount of memory, possibly
  leading to a crash, by sending a specially crafted message. (CVE-2014-3696) * An
  information disclosure flaw was discovered in the way Pidgin parsed XMPP
  messages. A malicious remote server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could
  potentially use this flaw to disclose a portion of memory belonging to the
  Pidgin process by sending a specially crafted XMPP message. (CVE-2014-3698) * An
  out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way Pidgin processed XML content. A
  malicious remote server could potentially use this flaw to crash Pidgin or
  execute arbitrary code in the context of the pidgin process. (CVE-2017-2640) *
  It was found that Pidgin's SSL/TLS plug-ins had a flaw in the certificate
  validation functionality. An attacker could use this flaw to create a fake
  certificate, that Pidgin would trust, which could be used to conduct
  man-in-the-middle attacks against Pidgin. (CVE-2014-3694) Red Hat would like to
  thank the Pidgin project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Yves
  Younan (Cisco Talos) and Richard Johnson (Cisco Talos) as the original reporters
  of CVE-2014-3695 and CVE-2014-3696 Thijs Alkemade and Paul Aurich as the
  original reporters of CVE-2014-3698 and Jacob Appelbaum and Moxie Marlinspike as
  the original reporters of CVE-2014-3694. Additional Changes: For detailed
  information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4
