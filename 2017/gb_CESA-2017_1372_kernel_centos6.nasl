  script_tag(name: "insight", value: "The kernel packages contain the Linux 
  kernel, the core of any Linux operating system. Security Fix(es): * A flaw was 
  found in the Linux kernel's handling of packets with the URG flag. Applications 
  using the splice() and tcp_splice_read() functionality can allow a remote 
  attacker to force the kernel to enter a condition in which it can loop 
  indefinitely. (CVE-2017-6214, Moderate) Bug Fix(es): * When executing certain 
  Hadoop jobs, a kernel panic occasionally occurred on multiple nodes of a 
  cluster. This update fixes the kernel scheduler, and the kernel panic no longer 
  occurs under the described circumstances. (BZ#1436241) * Previously, memory leak 
  of the struct cred data structure and related data structures occasionally 
  occurred. Consequently, system performance was suboptimal with the symptoms of 
  high I/O operations wait and small amount of free memory. This update fixes the 
  reference counter of the struct slab cache to no longer cause imbalance between 
  the calls to the get_cred() function and the put_cred() function. As a result, 
  the memory leak no longer occurs under the described circumstances. (BZ#1443234) 
  * Previously, the be2net driver could not detect the link status properly on IBM 
  Power Systems. Consequently, the link status was always reported as 
  disconnected. With this update, be2net has been fixed, and the Network Interface 
  Cards (NICs) now report the link status correctly. (BZ#1442979) * Previously, 
  the RFF_ID and RFT_ID commands in the lpfc driver were issued in an incorrect 
  order. Consequently, users were not able to access Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs). 
  With this update, lpfc has been fixed to issue RFT_ID before RFF_ID, which is 
  the correct order. As a result, users can now access LUNs as expected. 
  (BZ#1439636) * Previously, the kdump mechanism was trying to get the lock by the 
  vmalloc_sync_all() function during a kernel panic. Consequently, a deadlock 
  occurred, and the crashkernel did not boot. This update fixes the 
  vmalloc_sync_all() function to avoid synchronizing the vmalloc area on the 
  crashing CPU. As a result, the crashkernel parameter now boots as expected, and 
  the kernel dump is collected successfully under the described circumstances.
