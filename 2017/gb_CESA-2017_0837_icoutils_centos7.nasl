These files usually have the extension .ico or .cur, but they can also be

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple vulnerabilities were found in icoutils, in the wrestool program.
An attacker could create a crafted executable that, when read by wrestool,
could result in memory corruption leading to a crash or potential code
execution. (CVE-2017-5208, CVE-2017-5333, CVE-2017-6009)

* A vulnerability was found in icoutils, in the wrestool program. An
attacker could create a crafted executable that, when read by wrestool,
could result in failure to allocate memory or an over-large memcpy
operation, leading to a crash. (CVE-2017-5332)

* Multiple vulnerabilities were found in icoutils, in the icotool program.
An attacker could create a crafted ICO or CUR file that, when read by
icotool, could result in memory corruption leading to a crash or potential
code execution. (CVE-2017-6010, CVE-2017-6011)
