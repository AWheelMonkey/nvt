  Transport Layer Security (GnuTLS) library, which implements cryptographic 
  algorithms and protocols such as SSL, TLS, and DTLS. The following packages have 
  been upgraded to a later upstream version: gnutls (3.3.26). (BZ#1378373) 
  Security Fix(es): * A double-free flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed 
  certain X.509 certificates with Proxy Certificate Information extension. An 
  attacker could create a specially-crafted certificate which, when processed by 
  an application compiled against GnuTLS, could cause that application to crash. 
  (CVE-2017-5334) * Multiple flaws were found in the way gnutls processed OpenPGP 
  certificates. An attacker could create specially crafted OpenPGP certificates 
  which, when parsed by gnutls, would cause it to crash. (CVE-2017-5335, 
  CVE-2017-5336, CVE-2017-5337, CVE-2017-7869) * A null pointer dereference flaw 
  was found in the way GnuTLS processed ClientHello messages with status_request 
  extension. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an application 
  compiled with GnuTLS to crash. (CVE-2017-7507) * A flaw was found in the way 
  GnuTLS validated certificates using OCSP responses. This could falsely report a 
  certificate as valid under certain circumstances. (CVE-2016-7444) The 
  CVE-2017-7507 issue was discovered by Hubert Kario (Red Hat QE BaseOS Security 
  team). Additional Changes: For detailed information on changes in this release, 
  see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Release Notes linked from the References
