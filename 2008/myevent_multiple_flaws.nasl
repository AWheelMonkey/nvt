  script_tag(name:"summary", value:"The remote web server contains a PHP application that is affected by
  multiple vulnerabilities.

  Description :

  The remote host is running myEvent, a calendar application written in PHP.

  The installed version of myEvent fails to sanitize user input to the
  'myevent_path' parameter in several scripts before using it to include
  PHP code from other files. An unauthenticated attacker may be able to
  read arbitrary local files or include a file from a remote host that
  contains commands which will be executed on the remote host subject to
  the privileges of the web server process.

  In addition, user input to the 'event_id' parameter in 'addevent.php'
  and 'del.php', and to the 'event_desc' parameter in 'addevent.php' is
  not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query, which may
  allow an attacker to insert arbritrary SQL statements in the remote
  database.  A similar lack of sanitation involving the 'event_desc'
  parameter of 'addevent.php' allows for cross-site scripting attacks
  against the affected application.

  These flaws are exploitable only if PHP's register_globals is enabled.");
