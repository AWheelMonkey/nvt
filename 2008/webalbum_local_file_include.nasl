  local file include vulnerability.

  Description :

  The remote host is running WEBalbum, a photo album application written
  in PHP.

  The installed version of WEBalbum fails to sanitize user input to the
  'skin2' cookie in 'inc/inc_main.php' before using it to include
  arbitrary files.  An unauthenticated attacker may be able to read
  arbitrary local files or include a local file that contains commands
  which will be executed on the remote host subject to the privileges of
  the web server process.

  This flaw is only exploitable if PHP's 'magic_quotes_gpc' is disabled.");

  remove the product or replace the product by another one.");
