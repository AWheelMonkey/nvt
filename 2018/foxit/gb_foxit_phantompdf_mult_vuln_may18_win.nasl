  - An unsafe DLL loading as application passes an insufficiently qualified path

  - An out-of-bounds read and write error.

  - A type confusion error while executing certain XFA functions in crafted PDF
    files since the application could transform non-CXFA_Object to CXFA_Object
    without judging the data type and use the discrepant CXFA_Object to get layout
    object directly.

  - An unspecified error in GoToE & GoToR Actions.

  - The application is not running in Safe-Reading-Mode and can be abused via
    '_JP2_Codestream_Read_SOT' function.

  - An error as application do not handle a COM object properly.

  - A use-after-free error as the application could continue to traverse pages
    after the document has been closed or free certain objects repeatedly.

  - Uninitialized memory or pointer error due to the use of uninitialized new
    'Uint32Array' object or member variables in 'PrintParams' or 'm_pCurContex'
    objects.

  - A use-after-free error due to the use of freed object when executing JavaScript
    or invoking certain functions to get object properties.

  - A use-after-free error due to the use of object which has been closed or removed.

  - A type confusion error when parsing files with associated file annotations due
    to deference of an object of invalid type.");
