  script_tag(name:"summary",  value:"Busybox, utility programs for small and embedded systems, was affected
by several security vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues.

CVE-2011-5325

A path traversal vulnerability was found in Busybox implementation
of tar. tar will extract a symlink that points outside of the
current working directory and then follow that symlink when
extracting other files. This allows for a directory traversal
attack when extracting untrusted tarballs.

CVE-2013-1813

When device node or symlink in /dev should be created inside
2-or-deeper subdirectory (/dev/dir1/dir2.../node), the intermediate
directories are created with incorrect permissions.

CVE-2014-4607

An integer overflow may occur when processing any variant of a
'literal run' in the lzo1x_decompress_safe function. Each of these
three locations is subject to an integer overflow when processing
zero bytes. This exposes the code that copies literals to memory
corruption.

CVE-2014-9645

The add_probe function in modutils/modprobe.c in BusyBox allows
local users to bypass intended restrictions on loading kernel
modules via a / (slash) character in a module name, as demonstrated
by an 'ifconfig /usbserial up' command or a 'mount -t /snd_pcm none
/' command.

CVE-2016-2147

Integer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
malformed RFC1035-encoded domain name, which triggers an
out-of-bounds heap write.

CVE-2016-2148

Heap-based buffer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox
allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors
involving OPTION_6RD parsing.

CVE-2017-15873

The get_next_block function in archival/libarchive
/decompress_bunzip2.c in BusyBox has an Integer Overflow that may
lead to a write access violation.

CVE-2017-16544

In the add_match function in libbb/lineedit.c in BusyBox, the tab
autocomplete feature of the shell, used to get a list of filenames
in a directory, does not sanitize filenames and results in executing
any escape sequence in the terminal. This could potentially result
in code execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks.

CVE-2018-1000517

BusyBox contains a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in
Busybox wget that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow.
This attack appears to be exploitable via network connectivity.

CVE-2015-9621

Unziping a specially crafted zip file results in a computation of an
invalid pointer and a crash reading an invalid address.");
