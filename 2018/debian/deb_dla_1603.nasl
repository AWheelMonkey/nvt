CVE-2017-7177

Suricata has an IPv4 defragmentation evasion issue caused by lack
of a check for the IP protocol during fragment matching.

CVE-2017-15377

It was possible to trigger lots of redundant checks on the content
of crafted network traffic with a certain signature, because of
DetectEngineContentInspection in detect-engine-content-inspection.c.
The search engine doesn't stop when it should after no match is
found; instead, it stops only upon reaching inspection-recursion-
limit (3000 by default).

CVE-2018-6794

Suricata is prone to an HTTP detection bypass vulnerability in
detect.c and stream-tcp.c. If a malicious server breaks a normal
TCP flow and sends data before the 3-way handshake is complete,
then the data sent by the malicious server will be accepted by web
clients such as a web browser or Linux CLI utilities, but ignored
by Suricata IDS signatures. This mostly affects IDS signatures for
the HTTP protocol and TCP stream content; signatures for TCP packets
will inspect such network traffic as usual.

TEMP-0856648-2BC2C9 (no CVE assigned yet)

Out of bounds read in app-layer-dns-common.c.
On a zero size A or AAAA record, 4 or 16 bytes would still be read.");
