CVE-2017-5488

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
wp-admin/update-core.php in WordPress before 4.7.1 allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the name or
version header of a plugin.

CVE-2017-5489

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in WordPress before
4.7.1 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of
unspecified victims via vectors involving a Flash file upload.

CVE-2017-5490

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the theme-name fallback
functionality in wp-includes/class-wp-theme.php in WordPress before
4.7.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
via a crafted directory name of a theme, related to
wp-admin/includes/class-theme-installer-skin.php.

CVE-2017-5491

wp-mail.php in WordPress before 4.7.1 might allow remote attackers to
bypass intended posting restrictions via a spoofed mail server with the
mail.example.com name.

CVE-2017-5492

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the widget-editing
accessibility-mode feature in WordPress before 4.7.1 allows remote
attackers to hijack the authentication of unspecified victims for

CVE-2017-5493

wp-includes/ms-functions.php in the Multisite WordPress API in WordPress

restrictions via a crafted site signup or user signup.

CVE-2017-5610

wp-admin/includes/class-wp-press-this.php in Press This in WordPress
before 4.7.2 does not properly restrict visibility of a
taxonomy-assignment user interface, which allows remote attackers to
bypass intended access restrictions by reading terms.

CVE-2017-5611

SQL injection vulnerability in wp-includes/class-wp-query.php in
WP_Query in WordPress before 4.7.2 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary SQL commands by leveraging the presence of an affected
plugin or theme that mishandles a crafted post type name.

CVE-2017-5612

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
wp-admin/includes/class-wp-posts-list-table.php in the posts list
table in WordPress before 4.7.2 allows remote attackers to inject
