SSL/TLS library (nowadays continued under the name mbedtls) which could
result in plain text recovery via side-channel attacks.

Two other minor vulnerabilities were discovered in polarssl which could
result in arithmetic overflow errors.

CVE-2018-0497

As a protection against the Lucky Thirteen attack, the TLS code for
CBC decryption in encrypt-then-MAC mode performs extra MAC
calculations to compensate for variations in message size due to
padding. The amount of extra MAC calculation to perform was based on
the assumption that the bulk of the time is spent in processing
64-byte blocks, which is correct for most supported hashes but not for
SHA-384. Correct the amount of extra work for SHA-384 (and SHA-512
which is currently not used in TLS, and MD2 although no one should
care about that).

This is a regression fix for what CVE-2013-0169 had been fixed this.

CVE-2018-0498

The basis for the Lucky 13 family of attacks is for an attacker to be
able to distinguish between (long) valid TLS-CBC padding and invalid
TLS-CBC padding. Since our code sets padlen = 0 for invalid padding,
the length of the input to the HMAC function gives information about
that.

Information about this length (modulo the MD/SHA block size) can be
deduced from how much MD/SHA padding (this is distinct from TLS-CBC
padding) is used. If MD/SHA padding is read from a (static) buffer, a
local attacker could get information about how much is used via a
cache attack targeting that buffer.

Let's get rid of this buffer. Now the only buffer used is the
internal MD/SHA one, which is always read fully by the process()
function.

CVE-2018-9988

Prevent arithmetic overflow on bounds check and add bound check
before signature length read in ssl_parse_server_key_exchange().

CVE-2018-9989

Prevent arithmetic overflow on bounds check and add bound check
before length read in ssl_parse_server_psk_hint()");
