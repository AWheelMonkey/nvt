CVE-2017-12976

git-annex before 6.20170818 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary commands via an ssh URL with an initial dash character
in the hostname, as demonstrated by an ssh://-eProxyCommand= URL,
a related issue to CVE-2017-9800, CVE-2017-12836,
CVE-2017-1000116, and CVE-2017-1000117.

CVE-2018-10857

git-annex is vulnerable to a private data exposure and
exfiltration attack. It could expose the content of files located
outside the git-annex repository, or content from a private web
server on localhost or the LAN.

CVE-2018-10859

git-annex is vulnerable to an Information Exposure when decrypting
files. A malicious server for a special remote could trick
git-annex into decrypting a file that was encrypted to the user's
gpg key. This attack could be used to expose encrypted data that
was never stored in git-annex");
