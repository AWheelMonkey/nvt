CVE-2018-18245

Maximilian Boehner of usd AG found a cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability in Nagios Core. This vulnerability allows attackers
to place malicious JavaScript code into the web frontend through
manipulation of plugin output. In order to do this the attacker
needs to be able to manipulate the output returned by nagios
checks, e.g. by replacing a plugin on one of the monitored
endpoints. Execution of the payload then requires that an
authenticated user creates an alert summary report which contains
the corresponding output.

CVE-2016-9566

It was discovered that local users with access to an account in
the nagios group are able to gain root privileges via a symlink
attack on the debug log file.

CVE-2014-1878

An issue was corrected that allowed remote attackers to cause a
stack-based buffer overflow and subsequently a denial of service
(segmentation fault) via a long message to cmd.cgi.

CVE-2013-7205, CVE-2013-7108

A flaw was corrected in Nagios that could be exploited to cause a
denial-of-service. This vulnerability is induced due to an
off-by-one error within the process_cgivars() function, which can
be exploited to cause an out-of-bounds read by sending a
specially-crafted key value to the Nagios web UI.");
