allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or may have
other unspecified impact via a crafted JPEG 2000 image file.

CVE-2015-5221

Josselin Feist found a double-free vulnerability that allows remote
attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application crash) by
processing a malformed image file.

CVE-2016-8690

Gustavo Grieco discovered a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability
that can cause a denial-of-service via a crafted BMP image file. The

a denial-of-service.

CVE-2017-14132

A heap-based buffer over-read was found related to the
jas_image_ishomosamp function that could be triggered via a crafted
image file and may cause a denial-of-service (application crash) or
