service.

CVE-2017-12374

ClamAV has a use-after-free condition arising from a lack of input
validation. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability with
a crafted email message to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-12375

ClamAV has a buffer overflow vulnerability arising from a lack of
input validation. An unauthenticated remote attacker could send a
crafted email message to the affected device, triggering a buffer
overflow and potentially a denial of service when the malicious
message is scanned.

CVE-2017-12376

ClamAV has a buffer overflow vulnerability arising from improper
input validation when handling Portable Document Format (PDF) files.
An unauthenticated remote attacker could send a crafted PDF file to
the affected device, triggering a buffer overflow and potentially a
denial of service or arbitrary code execution when the malicious
file is scanned.

CVE-2017-12377

ClamAV has a heap overflow vulnerability arising from improper input
validation when handling mew packets. An attacker could exploit this
by sending a crafted message to the affected device, triggering a
denial of service or possible arbitrary code execution when the
malicious file is scanned.

CVE-2017-12378

ClamAV has a buffer overread vulnerability arising from improper
input validation when handling tape archive (TAR) files. An
unauthenticated remote attacker could send a crafted TAR file to
the affected device, triggering a buffer overread and potentially a
denial of service when the malicious file is scanned.

CVE-2017-12379

ClamAV has a buffer overflow vulnerability arising from improper
input validation in the message parsing function. An unauthenticated
remote attacker could send a crafted email message to the affected
device, triggering a buffer overflow and potentially a denial of
service or arbitrary code execution when the malicious message is
scanned.

CVE-2017-12380

ClamAV has a NULL dereference vulnerability arising from improper
input validation in the message parsing function. An unauthenticated
remote attacker could send a crafted email message to the affected
device, triggering a NULL pointer dereference, which may result in a
denial of service.

Debian Bug #824196

A malformed virus signature database could cause an application
crash and denial of service.");
