CVE-2017-10788

The DBD::mysql module through 4.042 for Perl allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and
application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by
triggering (1) certain error responses from a MySQL server or (2)
a loss of a network connection to a MySQL server. The
use-after-free defect was introduced by relying on incorrect
Oracle mysql_stmt_close documentation and code examples.

CVE-2017-10789

The DBD::mysql module through 4.042 for Perl uses the mysql_ssl=1
setting to mean that SSL is optional (even though this setting's
documentation has a 'your communication with the server will be
encrypted' statement), which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
spoof servers via a cleartext-downgrade attack, a related issue to
CVE-2015-3152.");
