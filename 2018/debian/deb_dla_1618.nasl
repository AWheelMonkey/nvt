CVE-2017-8361

The flac_buffer_copy function (flac.c) is affected by a buffer
overflow. This vulnerability might be leveraged by remote attackers to
cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a crafted audio file.

CVE-2017-8362

The flac_buffer_copy function (flac.c) is affected by an out-of-bounds
read vulnerability. This flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers to
cause a denial of service via a crafted audio file.

CVE-2017-8363

The flac_buffer_copy function (flac.c) is affected by a heap based OOB
read vulnerability. This flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers to
cause a denial of service via a crafted audio file.

CVE-2017-8365

The i2les_array function (pcm.c) is affected by a global buffer
overflow. This vulnerability might be leveraged by remote attackers to
cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a crafted audio file.

CVE-2017-14245
CVE-2017-14246
CVE-2017-17456
CVE-2017-17457

The d2alaw_array() and d2ulaw_array() functions (src/ulaw.c and
src/alaw.c) are affected by an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This
flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers to cause denial of service
or information disclosure via a crafted audio file.

CVE-2017-14634

The double64_init() function (double64.c) is affected by a
divide-by-zero error. This vulnerability might be leveraged by remote
attackers to cause denial of service via a crafted audio file.

CVE-2018-13139

The psf_memset function (common.c) is affected by a stack-based buffer
overflow. This vulnerability might be leveraged by remote attackers to
cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a crafted audio file. The vulnerability can be triggered by the
executable sndfile-deinterleave.

CVE-2018-19432

The sf_write_int function (src/sndfile.c) is affected by an
out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This flaw might be leveraged by
remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted audio file.

CVE-2018-19661
CVE-2018-19662

The i2alaw_array() and i2ulaw_array() functions (src/ulaw.c and
src/alaw.c) are affected by an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This
flaw might be leveraged by remote attackers to cause denial of service
or information disclosure via a crafted audio file.");
