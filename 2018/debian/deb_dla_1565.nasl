clustered file system. Buffer overflows and path traversal issues may
lead to information disclosure, denial-of-service or the execution of
arbitrary code.

CVE-2018-14651

It was found that the fix for CVE-2018-10927, CVE-2018-10928,
CVE-2018-10929, CVE-2018-10930, and CVE-2018-10926 was incomplete.
A remote, authenticated attacker could use one of these flaws to
execute arbitrary code, create arbitrary files, or cause denial of
service on glusterfs server nodes via symlinks to relative paths.

CVE-2018-14652

The Gluster file system is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the
'features/index' translator via the code handling the
'GF_XATTR_CLRLK_CMD' xattr in the 'pl_getxattr' function. A remote
authenticated attacker could exploit this on a mounted volume to
cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-14653

The Gluster file system is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer
overflow in the '__server_getspec' function via the 'gf_getspec_req'
RPC message. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this to
cause a denial of service or other potential unspecified impact.

CVE-2018-14659

The Gluster file system is vulnerable to a denial of service attack
via use of the 'GF_XATTR_IOSTATS_DUMP_KEY' xattr. A remote,
authenticated attacker could exploit this by mounting a Gluster
volume and repeatedly calling 'setxattr(2)' to trigger a state dump
and create an arbitrary number of files in the server's runtime
directory.

CVE-2018-14661

It was found that usage of snprintf function in feature/locks
translator of glusterfs server was vulnerable to a format string
attack. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to
cause remote denial of service.");
