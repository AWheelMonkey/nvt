CVE-2017-17742

Aaron Patterson reported that WEBrick bundled with Ruby was vulnerable to
an HTTP response splitting vulnerability. It was possible for an attacker
to inject fake HTTP responses if a script accepted an external input and
output it without modifications.

CVE-2018-6914

ooooooo_q discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in the
Dir.mktmpdir method in the tmpdir library. It made it possible for
attackers to create arbitrary directories or files via a .. (dot dot) in
the prefix argument.

CVE-2018-8777

Eric Wong reported an out-of-memory DoS vulnerability related to a large
request in WEBrick bundled with Ruby.

CVE-2018-8778

aerodudrizzt found a buffer under-read vulnerability in the Ruby
String#unpack method. If a big number was passed with the specifier @,
the number was treated as a negative value, and an out-of-buffer read
occurred. Attackers could read data on heaps if an script accepts an
external input as the argument of String#unpack.

CVE-2018-8779

ooooooo_q reported that the UNIXServer.open and UNIXSocket.open
methods of the socket library bundled with Ruby did not check for NUL
bytes in the path argument. The lack of check made the methods
vulnerable to unintentional socket creation and unintentional socket
access.

CVE-2018-8780

ooooooo_q discovered an unintentional directory traversal in
some methods in Dir, by the lack of checking for NUL bytes in their
parameter.");
