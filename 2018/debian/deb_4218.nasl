  script_tag(name:"summary",  value:"Several vulnerabilities were discovered in memcached, a high-performance
memory object caching system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2017-9951
Daniel Shapira reported a heap-based buffer over-read in memcached
(resulting from an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-8705) triggered by
specially crafted requests to add/set a key and allowing a remote
attacker to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-1000115 
It was reported that memcached listens to UDP by default. A remote
attacker can take advantage of it to use the memcached service as a
DDoS amplifier.

Default installations of memcached in Debian are not affected by
this issue as the installation defaults to listen only on localhost.
This update disables the UDP port by default. Listening on the UDP
can be re-enabled in the /etc/memcached.conf (cf.
/usr/share/doc/memcached/NEWS.Debian.gz).

CVE-2018-1000127 
An integer overflow was reported in memcached, resulting in resource
leaks, data corruption, deadlocks or crashes.");
