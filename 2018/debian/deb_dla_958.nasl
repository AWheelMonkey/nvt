  script_tag(name:"summary",  value:"CVE-2017-9224

An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in
Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A stack
out-of-bounds read occurs in match_at() during regular expression
searching. A logical error involving order of validation and access in
match_at() could result in an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer.

CVE-2017-9226

An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in
Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap
out-of-bounds write or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular
expression compilation. Octal numbers larger than 0xff are not handled
correctly in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc(). A malformed regular
expression containing an octal number in the form of '\700' would
produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff in
next_state_val(), resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory
corruption.

CVE-2017-9227

An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in
Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A stack
out-of-bounds read occurs in mbc_enc_len() during regular expression
searching. Invalid handling of reg-&gt;dmin in forward_search_range()
could result in an invalid pointer dereference, as an out-of-bounds
read from a stack buffer.

CVE-2017-9228

An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in
Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap
out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range() during regular
expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from an
incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in
parse_char_class() could create an execution path that leaves a
critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an index,
resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.

CVE-2017-9229

An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in
Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A SIGSEGV occurs
in left_adjust_char_head() during regular expression compilation.
Invalid handling of reg-&gt;dmax in forward_search_range() could result in
an invalid pointer dereference, normally as an immediate
denial-of-service condition.");
