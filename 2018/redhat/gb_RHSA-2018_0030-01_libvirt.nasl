  operating systems. In addition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of
  virtualized systems. Security Fix(es): * An industry-wide issue was found in the
  way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of
  instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary
  variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be
  exploited. Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing
  branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined
  instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory
  accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for
  speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a
  result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and
  guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache
  side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5715) Note: This is the libvirt side of the
  CVE-2017-5715 mitigation. Red Hat would like to thank Google Project Zero for
  reporting this issue.");
