  updates for Intel and AMD processors. Security Fix(es): * An industry-wide issue 
  was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented 
  speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance 
  optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the 
  way the speculative execution can be exploited. Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers 
  the speculative execution by utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the 
  presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as 
  well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the 
  microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that 
  never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use 
  this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host boundaries and read privileged 
  memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5715) Note: 
  This is the microcode counterpart of the CVE-2017-5715 kernel mitigation. Red 
  Hat would like to thank Google Project Zero for reporting this issue. ");
