  This update for otrs to version 4.0.32 fixes the following issues:

  These security issues were fixed:

  - CVE-2018-16586: An attacker could have sent a malicious email to an OTRS
  system. If a logged in user opens it, the email could have caused the
  browser to load external image or CSS resources (bsc#1109822).
  - CVE-2018-16587: An attacker could have sent a malicious email to an OTRS
  system. If a user with admin permissions opens it, it caused deletions
  of arbitrary files that the OTRS web server user has write access to
  (bsc#1109823).
  - CVE-2018-14593: An attacker who is logged into OTRS as an agent may have
  escalated their privileges by accessing a specially crafted URL
  (bsc#1103800).

  These non-security issues were fixed:

  - fixed permissions file @OTRS_ROOT@/var/tmp -  @OTRS_ROOT@/var/tmp/
  - ACL for Action AgentTicketBulk were inconsistent.
