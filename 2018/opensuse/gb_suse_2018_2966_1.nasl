  This update for zsh to version 5.6.2 fixes the following issues:

  These security issues were fixed:

  - CVE-2018-0502: The beginning of a #! script file was mishandled,
  potentially leading to an execve call to a program named on the second
  line (bsc#1107296)
  - CVE-2018-13259: Shebang lines exceeding 64 characters were truncated,
  potentially leading to an execve call to a program name that is a
  substring of the intended one (bsc#1107294)
  - CVE-2018-1100: Prevent stack-based buffer overflow in the
  utils.c:checkmailpath function that allowed local attackers to execute
  arbitrary code in the context of another user (bsc#1089030).
  - CVE-2018-1071: Prevent stack-based buffer overflow in the
  exec.c:hashcmd() function that allowed local attackers to cause a denial
  of service (bsc#1084656).
  - CVE-2018-1083: Prevent buffer overflow in the shell autocomplete
  functionality that allowed local unprivileged users to create a
  specially crafted directory path which lead to code execution in the
  context of the user who tries to use autocomplete to traverse the
  mentioned path (bsc#1087026).
  - Disallow evaluation of the initial values of integer variables imported
  from the environment

  These non-security issues were fixed:

  - Fixed that the signal SIGWINCH was being ignored when zsh is not in the
  foreground.
  - Fixed two regressions with pipelines getting backgrounded and emitting
  the signal SIGTTOU
  - The effect of the NO_INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS option extends into $(...) and
  `...` command substitutions when used on the command line.
  - The 'exec' and 'command' precommand modifiers, and options to them, are
  now parsed after parameter expansion.
  - Functions executed by ZLE widgets no longer have their standard input
  closed, but redirected from /dev/null instead.
  - There is an option WARN_NESTED_VAR, a companion to the existing
  WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL that causes a warning if a function updates a
  variable from an enclosing scope without using typeset -g.
  - zmodload now has an option -s to be silent on a failure to find a module
  but still print other errors.
  - Fix typo in chflags completion
  - Fixed invalid git commands completion
  - VCS info system: vcs_info git: Avoid a fork.
  - Fix handling of 'printf -' and 'printf --'
  - fix broken completion for filterdiff (boo#1019130)
  - Unicode9 support, this needs support from your terminal to work
  correctly.
  - The new word modifier ':P' computes the physical path of the argument.
  - The output of 'typeset -p' uses 'export' commands or the '-g'
  option for parameters that are not local to the cu ...
