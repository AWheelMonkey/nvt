  traversal strings (such as '../') to gain access to arbitrary files on the targeted system. This may
  result in the disclosure of sensitive information or lead to a complete compromise of the affected computer.");

  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Originally reported as a Tomcat vulnerability the root cause of this issue is that
  the JVM does not correctly decode UTF-8 encoded URLs to UTF-8. This exposes a directory traversal vulnerability when
  the connector uses URIEncoding="UTF-8". This directory traversal is limited to the docBase of the web application.

  If a context is configured with allowLinking="true" then the directory traversal vulnerability is extended to the
  entire file system of the host server.

  It should also be noted that setting useBodyEncodingForURI="true" has the same effect as setting URIEncoding="UTF-8"
  when processing requests with bodies encoded with UTF-8.

  Although the root cause was quickly identified as a JVM issue and that it affected multiple JVMs from multiple vendors,
  it was decided to report this as a Tomcat vulnerability until such time as the JVM vendors provided updates to resolve
  this issue. For further information on the status of this issue for your JVM, contact your JVM vendor.');

  a workaround that protects against this and any similar character encoding issues that may still exist in the JVM.");
