Security Fix(es):

* 389-ds-base: race condition on reference counter leads to DoS using
persistent search (CVE-2018-10850)

* 389-ds-base: ldapsearch with server side sort allows users to cause a
crash (CVE-2018-10935)

* 389-ds-base: Server crash through modify command with large DN
(CVE-2018-14624)

* 389-ds-base: Crash in delete_passwdPolicy when persistent search
connections are terminated unexpectedly (CVE-2018-14638)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS
score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in
the References section.

The CVE-2018-10850 issue was discovered by Thierry Bordaz (Red Hat) and the
CVE-2018-14638 issue was discovered by Viktor Ashirov (Red Hat).

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the nucn-stans framework was enabled by default in Directory
Server, but the framework is not stable. As a consequence, deadlocks and
file descriptor leaks could occur. This update changes the default value of
the nsslapd-enable-nunc-stans parameter to 'off'. As a result, Directory
Server is now stable. (BZ#1614836)

* When a search evaluates the 'shadowAccount' entry, Directory Server adds
the shadow attributes to the entry. If the fine-grained password policy is
enabled, the 'shadowAccount' entry can contain its own 'pwdpolicysubentry'
policy attribute. Previously, to retrieve this attribute, the server
started an internal search for each 'shadowAccount' entry, which was
unnecessary because the entry was already known to the server. With this
update, Directory Server only starts internal searches if the entry is not
known. As a result, the performance of searches, such as response time and
throughput, is improved. (BZ#1615924)
