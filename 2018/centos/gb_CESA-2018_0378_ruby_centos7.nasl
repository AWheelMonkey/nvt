Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the Net::FTP module did not properly process
filenames in combination with certain operations. A remote attacker could
exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary commands by setting up a malicious
FTP server and tricking a user or Ruby application into downloading files
with specially crafted names using the Net::FTP module. (CVE-2017-17405)

* A buffer underflow was found in ruby's sprintf function. An attacker,
with ability to control its format string parameter, could send a specially
crafted string that would disclose heap memory or crash the interpreter.
(CVE-2017-0898)

* It was found that rubygems did not sanitize gem names during installation
of a given gem. A specially crafted gem could use this flaw to install
files outside of the regular directory. (CVE-2017-0901)

* A vulnerability was found where rubygems did not sanitize DNS responses
when requesting the hostname of the rubygems server for a domain, via a
_rubygems._tcp DNS SRV query. An attacker with the ability to manipulate
DNS responses could direct the gem command towards a different domain.
(CVE-2017-0902)

* A vulnerability was found where the rubygems module was vulnerable to an
unsafe YAML deserialization when inspecting a gem. Applications inspecting
gem files without installing them can be tricked to execute arbitrary code
in the context of the ruby interpreter. (CVE-2017-0903)

* It was found that WEBrick did not sanitize all its log messages. If logs
were printed in a terminal, an attacker could interact with the terminal
via the use of escape sequences. (CVE-2017-10784)

* It was found that the decode method of the OpenSSL::ASN1 module was
vulnerable to buffer underrun. An attacker could pass a specially crafted
string to the application in order to crash the ruby interpreter, causing a
denial of service. (CVE-2017-14033)

* A vulnerability was found where rubygems did not properly sanitize gems'
specification text. A specially crafted gem could interact with the
terminal via the use of escape sequences. (CVE-2017-0899)

* It was found that rubygems could use an excessive amount of CPU while
parsing a sufficiently long gem summary. A specially crafted gem from a gem
repository could freeze gem commands attempting to parse its summary.
(CVE-2017-0900)

* A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the JSON extension of ruby.
An attacker with the ability to pass a specially crafted JSON input to the
extension could use this flaw to ex ...
