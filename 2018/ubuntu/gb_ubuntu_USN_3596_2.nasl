  The update caused an issue where it was not possible to customize the toolbars
  when running Firefox in Unity. This update fixes the problem. We apologize for
  the inconvenience. Original advisory details: Multiple security issues were
  discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
  website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of
  service via application crash or opening new tabs, escape the sandbox, bypass
  same-origin restrictions, obtain sensitive information, confuse the user with
  misleading permission requests, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-5125,
  CVE-2018-5126, CVE-2018-5127, CVE-2018-5128, CVE-2018-5129, CVE-2018-5130,
  CVE-2018-5136, CVE-2018-5137, CVE-2018-5140, CVE-2018-5141, CVE-2018-5142) It
  was discovered that the fetch() API could incorrectly return cached copies of
  no-store/no-cache resources in some circumstances. A local attacker could
  potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information in environments where
  multiple users share a common profile. (CVE-2018-5131) Multiple security issues
  were discovered with WebExtensions. If a user were tricked in to installing a
  specially crafted extension, an attacker could potentially exploit these to
  obtain sensitive information or bypass security restrictions. (CVE-2018-5132,
  CVE-2018-5134, CVE-2018-5135) It was discovered that the value of
  app.support.baseURL is not sanitized properly. If a malicious local application
  were to set this to a specially crafted value, an attacker could potentially
  exploit this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-5133) It was discovered that
  javascript: URLs with embedded tab characters could be pasted in to the
  addressbar. If a user were tricked in to copying a specially crafted URL in to
  the addressbar, an attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2018-5143)");
