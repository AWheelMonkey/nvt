Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions. If a user
were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker
could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information, or bypass
security restrictions. (CVE-2018-5152, CVE-2018-5166)

It was discovered that the web console and JavaScript debugger incorrectly
linkified chrome: and javascript URLs. If a user were tricked in to
clicking a specially crafted link, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2018-5167)

It was discovered that dragging and dropping link text on to the home
button could set the home page to include chrome pages. If a user were
tricked in to dragging and dropping a specially crafted link on to the
home button, an attacker could potentially exploit this bypass security
restrictions. (CVE-2018-5169)

It was discovered that the Live Bookmarks page and PDF viewer would run
script pasted from the clipboard. If a user were tricked in to copying and
pasting specially crafted text, an attacker could potentially exploit this
to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2018-5172)

It was discovered that the JSON viewer incorrectly linkified javascript:
URLs. If a user were tricked in to clicking on a specially crafted link,
an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive
information. (CVE-2018-5176)

It was discovered that dragging a file: URL on to a tab that is running in
a different process would cause the file to open in that process. If a
user were tricked in to dragging a file: URL, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to bypass intended security policies.
(CVE-2018-5181)

It was discovered that dragging text that is a file: URL on to the
addressbar would open the specified file. If a user were tricked in to
dragging specially crafted text on to the addressbar, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to bypass intended security policies.
