Artem Smotrakov discovered that the HTTP client redirection handler
implementation in OpenJDK did not clear potentially sensitive information
in HTTP headers when following redirections to different hosts. An attacker
could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-3139)

It was discovered that the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)
implementation in OpenJDK did not properly enforce restrictions specified
by system properties in some situations. An attacker could potentially use
this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-3149)

It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly
perform access checks in certain cases when performing field link
resolution. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted
Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions.
(CVE-2018-3169)

Felix Dörre discovered that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE)
implementation in OpenJDK did not ensure that the same endpoint
identification algorithm was used during TLS session resumption as during
initial session setup. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive
information. (CVE-2018-3180)");
