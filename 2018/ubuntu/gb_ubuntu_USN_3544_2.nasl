  The update caused a web compatibility regression and a tab crash during printing
  in some circumstances. This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the
  inconvenience. Original advisory details: Multiple security issues were
  discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
  website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of
  service via application crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick
  the user in to providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the
  addressbar contents, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-5089, CVE-2018-5090,

  CVE-2018-5115, CVE-2018-5117, CVE-2018-5122) Multiple security issues were
  discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially
  crafted extension, an attacker could potentially exploit these to gain
  additional privileges, bypass same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary
  code. (CVE-2018-5105, CVE-2018-5113, CVE-2018-5116) A security issue was
  discovered with the developer tools. If a user were tricked in to opening a
  specially crafted website with the developer tools open, an attacker could
  potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from other origins.
  (CVE-2018-5106) A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could
  potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.
  (CVE-2018-5107) It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be
  accessed by subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to
  entering a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain
  sensitive information from a private browsing context. (CVE-2018-5108) It was
  discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the addressbar
  could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were tricked in to opening
  a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to the addressbar, an attacker
  could potentially exploit this to spoof the addressbar contents. (CVE-2018-5111)
  It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open
  non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially crafted
  extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could potentially exploit
  this to gain additional privileges. (CVE-2018-5112) It was discovered that
