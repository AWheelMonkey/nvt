  syscall. A local attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary
  code in setuid programs and gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2018-1000001) A
  memory leak was discovered in the _dl_init_paths() function in the GNU C library
  dynamic loader. A local attacker could potentially exploit this with a specially
  crafted value in the LD_HWCAP_MASK environment variable, in combination with
  CVE-2017-1000409 and another vulnerability on a system with hardlink protections
  disabled, in order to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2017-1000408) A
  heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the _dl_init_paths() function in
  the GNU C library dynamic loader. A local attacker could potentially exploit
  this with a specially crafted value in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable,
  in combination with CVE-2017-1000408 and another vulnerability on a system with
  hardlink protections disabled, in order to gain administrative privileges.
  (CVE-2017-1000409) An off-by-one error leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
  was discovered in the GNU C library glob() implementation. An attacker could
  potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code
  via a maliciously crafted pattern. (CVE-2017-15670) A heap-based buffer overflow
  was discovered during unescaping of user names with the ~ operator in the GNU C
  library glob() implementation. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
  cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via a maliciously crafted
  pattern. (CVE-2017-15804) It was discovered that the GNU C library dynamic
  loader mishandles RPATH and RUNPATH containing $ORIGIN for privileged (setuid or
  AT_SECURE) programs. A local attacker could potentially exploit this by
  providing a specially crafted library in the current working directory in order
  to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2017-16997) It was discovered that the
  GNU C library malloc() implementation could return a memory block that is too
  small if an attempt is made to allocate an object whose size is close to
  SIZE_MAX, resulting in a heap-based overflow. An attacker could potentially
  exploit this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue
  only affected Ubuntu 17.10. (CVE-2017-17426)");
