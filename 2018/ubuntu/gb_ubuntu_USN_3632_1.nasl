  leading to a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of
  the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
  (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0861) It was
  discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed passthrough
  of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to
  cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2017-1000407) It
  was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the network
  namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this
  to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2017-15129) It was discovered that the HugeTLB component of the Linux
  kernel did not properly handle holes in hugetlb ranges. A local attacker could
  use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-16994) It
  was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not properly
  restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local attacker could
  use this to bypass intended access restrictions. (CVE-2017-17448) It was
  discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt_osf) module did not
  properly perform access control checks. A local attacker could improperly modify
  the system-wide OS fingerprint list. (CVE-2017-17450) Dmitry Vyukov discovered
  that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read
  when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local attacker could use this to expose
  sensitive information. (CVE-2017-17741) It was discovered that the Salsa20
  encryption algorithm implementations in the Linux kernel did not properly handle
  zero-length inputs. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
  (system crash). (CVE-2017-17805) It was discovered that the HMAC implementation
  did not validate the state of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A
  local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
  possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-17806) It was discovered that the
  keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check permissions
  when a key request was performed on a task's default keyring. A local attacker
  could use this to add keys to unauthorized keyrings. (CVE-2017-17807) It was
  discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the Linux kernel did
  not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet sizes. An attacker
  could use this to cause a denial of service (interface unavailability).
