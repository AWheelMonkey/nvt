  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The keepalived utility provides simple and robust facilities for load
balancing and high availability. The load balancing framework relies on the
well-known and widely used IP Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module providing
layer-4 (transport layer) load balancing. Keepalived implements a set of
checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain and manage a load balanced
server pool according to the health of the servers. Keepalived also
implements the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv2) to achieve high
availability with director failover.

Security Fix(es):

* keepalived: Heap-based buffer overflow when parsing HTTP status codes
allows for denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution
(CVE-2018-19115)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS
score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in
the References section.
