CVE-2018-4056 
An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in the coTURN administrator
web portal. As the administration web interface is shared with the
production, it is unfortunately not possible to easily filter outside
access and this security update completely disable the web interface. Users
should use the local, command line interface instead.

CVE-2018-4058 
Default configuration enables unsafe loopback forwarding. A remote attacker
with access to the TURN interface can use this vulnerability to gain access
to services that should be local only.

CVE-2018-4059Default configuration uses an empty password for the local command line
administration interface. An attacker with access to the local console
(either a local attacker or a remote attacker taking advantage of
CVE-2018-4058 
)
could escalade privileges to administrator of the coTURN
server.");
